Similar to other \nupgrade software, the fix pack image also can be locally installed on a \ncomputer where the product software is not already installed.\n* You can populate agents to the depot.\n* You can remotely deploy agents to existing or new installations.\n\nWhen this fix pack image is downloaded from Passport Advantage, these rules \napply:\n* You can locally install the fix pack on a system that already hosts a \nlicensed copy of IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Databases.\n* You can locally install the fix pack on a system that does not already host \na licensed copy of IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Databases.\n* You can populate agents to the depot.\n* You can remotely deploy agents to existing or new installations.\n\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix\n-----------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Upgrade prerequisites \nfor this fix' must be installed when for upgrade.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\ibm\\itm'\non Windows systems.\n\n- If you have customized the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent \noy.ini file on UNIX system, this file should be backed up before the fix \ninstall. After this fix is installed, edit the latest oy.ini file and merge \nyour modifications into this oy.ini file.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to a temporary \ndirectory on the system that contains the agent code to be updated. \nFor the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully \nqualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows, this includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or \nan unzip utility on Windows systems. This creates a directory \nstructure that contains fixes for all of the supported platforms.\n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"ITCAM for Applications, Version 7.2.1.2 \nInstallation and Setup Guide\" to install the agent.\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. After agent upgrade bitness of agent binary should be same as pre-upgrade on x86-64 \nbit windows. Agent do not support upgrade to 64 bit binary.\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update and installation\n----------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to \na temporary directory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server system. For the purpose of this README, the \nsymbol <TEMP> represents the fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows, this includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. This creates a directory structure\nthat contains fixes for all of the supported operating systems.\n\n3. To add the fix pack bundles into the remote deploy depot, use the\ntacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems\nor in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more information\non the tacmd addBundles command, see Appendix A. Commands reference\nof the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/CNN25ML:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/CNN25ML/WINDOWS/Deploy -t oy -f\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>/CNN25ML/unix -t oy -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot.\n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case or \nrepresents the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\nOn a Windows system: if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>/CNN25ML:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\CNN25ML\\WINDOWS\\Deploy -t oy -f\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -i <TEMP>\\CNN25ML\\unix -t oy -f \n\nwhere:\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n-t is the product code of the product to add, in this case oy \nrepresents the Monitoring Agent for Sybase Agent\n-f performs the actions without asking for confirmation\n\n5. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following tacmd commands. For more information on the\ntacmd login and updateAgent commands, see Appendix A. Commands\nreference of the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring Administrator's Guide.\"\n\nOn a UNIX system: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t oy \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 062002000\n\nOn a Windows system:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the managed system name for the OS agent on the \nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t OY \n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 062002000\n\nIf there are not prior version koy agent on remote system .Then use \nbelow tacmd addSystem command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addSystem -t OY \n-n <Managed system name> \n-p INSTANCE=\"<Sybase instance name>\"\n\nNote:\n- The <Sybase instance name> is the Sybase agent instance name to be monitored on \nremote system.\n- The component (-t) for the updateAgent command is specified as \ntwo characters (oy), not three characters (koy).\n- The node (-n) for the updateAgent command is the managed system\nname of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated. The \ntarget node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.\n-Remote installation will fail if the MTEMS window is open on the agent machine.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring \nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop:\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file (CNN25ML.tar.gz or .iso) to \nthe IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"ITCAM for Applications, Version 7.2.1.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n=======================================\n6.1 Verifying the update\n-------------------------\n1.To verify whether the agent is updated correctly, use the tacmd command to\nview the current version of the agent after the agent is restarted. Ensure that\nyou log on to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent\nversion.\nFor example,\n\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory, the default location is /opt/IBM/ITM.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t OY\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is C:\\IBM\\ITM.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t OY\n\nNote:\nThe component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified as two\ncharacters (OY), not three characters (KOY).\n\nWhen the agent is updated, the agent version is changed to 06.20.02.00.\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify whether the\nagent was updated. For the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n06.20.02.00.\n\n2.To verify whether the agent support files are updated correctly, use the\nkincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on Linux or UNIX\nsystems.\n\nOn UNIX or Linux systems:\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the following command:\n$CANDLEHOME/bin/cinfo -i\n\nSample output for the cinfo command on a UNIX or Linux systems\n----------------------------------------------------------\n[root@HJS-SYB-1 bin]# ./cinfo\n\n*********** Wed Nov 29 23:53:13 IST 2017 ******************\nUser: root Groups: root\nHost name : HJS-SYB-1 Installer Lvl:06.30.06.00\nCandleHome: /opt/IBM0611/ITM\n***********************************************************\n\n-- CINFO Menu --\n1) Show products installed in this CandleHome\n2) Show which products are currently running\n3) Show configuration settings\n4) Exit CINFO\n1\n\n*********** Wed Nov 29 23:53:15 IST 2017 ******************\nUser: root Groups: root\nHost name : HJS-SYB-1 Installer Lvl:06.30.06.00\nCandleHome: /opt/IBM0611/ITM\n***********************************************************\n...Product inventory\n\nax IBM Tivoli Monitoring Shared Libraries\nlx8266 Version: 06.30.06.00\n\ngs IBM GSKit Security Interface\nlx8266 Version: 08.00.50.36\n\njr Tivoli Enterprise-supplied JRE\nlx8266 Version: 07.09.01.00\n\noy Monitoring Agent for Sybase server\nlx8266 Version: 06.20.02.00\n\nui Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\n\nOn Windows systems:\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the following command:\n%CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\kincinfo \u2013i\n\nSample output of the kincinfo command on a Windows System\n----------------------------------------------------------\nC:\\IBM\\ITM\\BIN>kincinfo -i\n********** Thursday, November 30, 2017 10:10:02 AM **********\nUser : Administrator Group : NA\nHost Name : HJ-IBMIBM6737 Installer : Ver: 063006000\nCandleHome : C:\\IBM\\ITM\nInstallitm : C:\\IBM\\ITM\\InstallITM\n*************************************************************\n...Product Inventory\n\nIN Install INS/Windows Install Component\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nIN TEMA(32-bit) INS/ITM 6.x Agent Install Component\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nIN TEMA(64-bit) INS/ITM 6.x Agent Install Component Extensions\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nAC KAC(64-bit) CMA/32/64 Bit Agent Compatibility Package\nWIX64 Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\nGL KGL(64-bit) CMA/Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent Framework\nWIX64 Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: d5334a\n\nGL KGL(32-bit) CMA/Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Agent Framework\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: d5334a\n\nGS KGS(64-bit) GSK/IBM GSKit Security Interface\nWIX64 Version: 08.00.50.36 Build: d5313a\n\nGS KGS(32-bit) GSK/IBM GSKit Security Interface\nWINNT Version: 08.00.50.36 Build: d5313a\n\nJM KJM(32-bit) JVM/Embedded JVM\nWINNT Version: 07.09.01.00 Build: 201506221629\n\nNT KNT(32-bit) CMA/Monitoring Agent for Windows OS\nWINNT Version: 06.30.00.00 Build: 30321\n\nOY KOY(32-bit) CMA/Monitoring Agent for Sybase Server\nWINNT Version: 06.20.02.00 Build: 72651\n\nUE KUE(32-bit) CMA/Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface Extensions\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: d5334a\n\nUI KUI(32-bit) CLI/Tivoli Enterprise Services User Interface\nWINNT Version: 06.30.06.00 Build: 201511302132\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n==================================\nProblem: Sybase agent configuration is not working using itmcmd manage \ncommand from GUI on Solaris 11\nWorkaround:\nFor Solaris 11:\nRun './itmcmd config -A oy' present at location:<CandleHome>/bin\n\nProblem: Prereqchecker which is integrated with the installer fails on \nwindows platform.\nWorkaround: \nFor Windows:\nRun on command prompt \u2018prereq_checker.bat KOY\u2019 present at location:\nInstallerPath\\Sybase_Agent_Installer\\WINDOWS\\prereqchecker\n\nFor Unix:\nRun \u2018./prereq_checker.sh KOY\u2019 present at location:\nInstallerPath\\Sybase_Agent_Installer\\unix\\prereqchecker\n\nProblem: Registry entries are not cleared when agent is uninstalled on 64 bit\nwindows platform.\nWorkaround: Delete registry entries manually from path:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Candle\\KOY\\610\\\n\nProblem: When running the verification step in the \"itmcmd config -A oy\"\nfunction on a Solaris 10 system, the following output from the verification\nprogram is produced: \"user needs read authority to\".\nWorkaround: Issue \"ps -ef | grep koyagent\" to locate the koyagent process and\nissue \"kill -9\" for that process. Check the Navigator tree in the Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal for an offline koyagent entry and clear the offline entry.\nThe Monitoring Agent for Sybase Server that was configured by \"itmcmd config\" \nis unaffected by this problem. \n\nProblem: When running multiple remote deploys and agent upgrades, a task\ntimeout occurs during either the remote deployment or the agent upgrade. \nWorkaround: Restart the OS Agent following the task timeout and before\nperforming the next remote deployment or agent upgrade.\n\nProblem: If you are installing this fix into a depot on a Windows computer, and\nWinZip(R) is used to extract this fix, text files in the depot might contain\nCTRL-Ms. When this fix is remotely deployed to a UNIX machine from the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server or depot on Windows, the installation fails. The\nCTRL-Ms are caused by extracting the fix using WinZip with \"TAR file smart\nCR/LF conversion\" option enabled. This extraction causes WinZip to put CTRL-Ms\nin text files when they are extracted on UNIX through remote deployment. \nWorkaround: If you are using WinZip for the fix installation for the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server on Windows, disable the default \"TAR file smart\nCR/LF conversion\" option. \n\nProblem: In the Tivoli Enterprise Portal, the instance name is displayed\ninstead of the host name in the Navigation tree. \nFor example the Navigation tree might look like this,\nMySid\nSybase\nAlert Log\n...\ninstead of this,\nMyHost\nSybase - MySid\nAlert Log\n...\n\nThe problem is that the length of the managed node name, <SID>:<HOSTNAME>:SYB,\nexceeds the length supported by the portal. A possible cause is that the\nfully-qualified host name is being used. If 'uname -n' on the Monitoring Agent\nfor Sybase Server computer returns a fully-qualified host name, then this host\nname is the cause. \nWorkaround: Override the host name with an appropriate shorter name by adding\nthe following line to oy.config: \nexport COLL_HOSTNAME=<short name>\n\n\n8.0 Additional product information \n==================================\nSteps for enabling SDA (Self-describing agent)\nFor Windows:\n1.On the computer where the monitoring server is installed, in the Manage\nTivoli Enterprise Monitoring Services application, right-click the agent and \nselect Advanced\u2192 Edit ENV file.\n2.Edit the existing environment variable to: TEMA_SDA=Y.\n\nFor UNIX:\n1.On the computer where the monitoring agent is installed, change to the\n<Install_dir>/config/ directory.\n2.Open the coordinating file:\nFor single-instance agents: <pc>.ini \nFor multi-instance agents: <pc>_<instance>.ini file \nWhere pc is the two-character product code.\n3.Edit the existing environment variable to: TEMA_SDA=Y.\n\n\n9.0 Copyright and trademark information \n========================================\nIBM, the IBM logo, and ibm.com are trademarks or registered trademarks of\nInternational Business Machines Corp., registered in many jurisdictions\nworldwide.

This error can occur if the application server finds an earlier version of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS in the class path. The error can also occur if you do not configure WebSphere Application Server to use the correct version of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS.\" \n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe mqjavalist.sh script runs on Linux and UNIX systems and can identify Java archives and classes from MQ V5.3 and later versions. Although the mqjavalist.sh script does not run on Windows systems, it is possible to zip up a directory structure on Windows in order to examine it with mqjavalist.sh on a different system. To use the mqjavalist.sh script, download it from the bottom of this page, copy it to the target system, and make the script executable. Make sure that either the unzip command or the Java jar command is available in your PATH before running mqjavalist.sh. For example:\n\n\n\n 1. Preparing to run mqjavalist.sh\n 2. \n 3.  sh> chmod +x mqjavalist.sh \n    sh> PATH=$PATH:/opt/java7/bin \n    \n\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nIBM MQ ships a number of Java archives (jar files) that applications use to connect to MQ and work with messages. For Java EE environments, MQ provides a Resource Adapter called wmq.jmsra.rar which contains the jar files required by JMS applications. Java SE and Java EE applications must use a consistent set of MQ jar files at the same maintenance level, or else they might experience a wide variety of problems including intermittent errors, performance problems, and other failures.\n\nIt is common to find multiple versions of the MQ jar files in the Java CLASSPATH, or invalidly bundled in Java applications (.ear, .war, and .jar files). Finding and eliminating duplicate copies of the MQ jar files can be a difficult task, but the mqjavalist.sh script simplifies that task on Linux and UNIX systems.\n\n\n\n * Syntax\n * Examples\n * WebSphere Application Server\n * Sample output\n * Resolving problems\n * Download\n\n\n\nSYNTAX\n\n 1.  mqjavalist.sh -? | -h \n 2.  \n 3.  mqjavalist.sh [-v] [-r] [-f File] -d Directory ...\n 4.  \n 5.  \n 6.  \n 7.  -?:\n 8.  \n 9.  \n 10. -h:\n 11. \n 12. \n 13. -v:\n 14. \n 15. \n 16. -r:\n 17. \n 18. \n 19. -f File\u200b:\n 20. \n 21. \n 22. -d Directory:\n 23. \n 24. \n 25. \n 26. \n 27. \n 28.

Otherwise, the application servers in that profile will use the old MQ Resource Adapter jars under the profile installedConnectors/wmq.jmsra.rar directory rather than the MQ jars in the main installedConnectors/wmq.jmsra.rar directory, which are kept up to date by WebSphere Application Server fix packs.\n\n\n 1.

Back to top\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nReview the output from mqjavalist.sh to determine where copies of the MQ jar files have been found. Not all duplicates represent a problem, unless they are being loaded by your Java SE application or Java EE application server at runtime. If the com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar file shows an implementation version of ${version.number} - ${build.level} just ignore it.\n\nIn the sample output above, entries #16 through #27 represent the jar files for the installed MQ Resource Adapter. They all show an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1 except for #21, com.ibm.mqjms.jar, which shows an implementation version of 7.0.1.5 - k701-105-110419. Because the jar file versions are not in sync, MQ JMS will not function as expected.\n\nIn cases like this, the wmq.jmsra.rar file should contain a copy of the MQ jar at the right level for the application server. Entry #14 in the mqjavalist.sh output shows the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file with an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1, which is what we need. Use the jar program to extract the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file from the wmq.jmsra.rar archive, then copy it over the back-level version of the jar. Use chown and chmod to ensure the permissions on the file are correct.\n\nIn other cases, you might find that the classpath for the application server, or for your Java SE application, is picking up extra copies of the MQ jar files. Eliminating unnecessary classpath entries can resolve the problem.\n\nIf your Java EE application (.ear or .war) bundles a copy of any MQ jar files, you should remove them and rely on the ones from the installed MQ Resource Adapter instead.\n\nBack to top\n\n\nAdditional Keywords: \ntroubleshoot troubleshooting trouble shoot classloader classpath configuration scripts\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD\n 1. \n 2. mqjavalist.sh [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21681142&amp;aid=2]mqjavalist.sh\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: All source code and/or binaries attached to this document are referred to here as \"the Program\".

\nthe value of the Percent_Free_To_Max attribute incorrectly, because this value\nshould be greater than the value of the Percent_Free_To_Allocated attribute\nin case the Oracle tablespace is set with Autoextend ON and \nthe maximum file size of the data file is greater than the allocated size \nfor the current datafile.\n\n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0002\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAPAR: IV08618\nAbstract : AGENT OCCUPY ORACLE SESSION MORE AND MORE\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent occupies the\nOracle sessions increasingly if the Oracle Database Extended agent user\ndoes not have all authorities in the krzgrant.sql file.\nThis increase is caused by the agent not disconnecting from the Oracle\ndatabase, with an error message of \"ORA-00942 Table or View does not\nexist,\" and the agent trying to reconnect to the Oracle database with a new\nsession in each interval.\n\nDefect: 167731\nAbstract: agent configure still load based version xml file.\nAdditional Information: A new rz_dd_063100002.xml file is\ninstalled in the itmhome\\config directory by this patch, \nwhere the base version of the rz_dd_063100000.xml file is installed.\n\nThe agent loads the configuration definition from the newly installed\nrz_dd_063100002.xml file instead of the base version file.\n\nDefect: 168694\nAbstract: cannot ignore Oracle Listener/Net Service definition.\nAdditional Information: A new KRZ_LOAD_ORACLE_NET environment variable \nis added so you can decide whether the Listener and Net Service End Points\nfrom the files below are required for monitoring.\n\nOn UNIX and Linux systems:\n$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora\n$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN/network/admin/listener.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN/network/admin/tnsnames.ora\n\nOn Windows

variable is set to 'false', the agent\ndoes not load Listener or Net Service definitions from the files above,\neven if the agent is configured with ORACLE HOME directory.\n\nThe agent still loads Listener or Net Service definition if the agent\nis configured with a TNS PATH directory, which contains the\nlistener.ora or tnsnames.ora files.\n\nDefect: 168966\nAbstract: ASM disk/diskgroup display redundancy data.\nAdditional Information: In an Oracle RAC environment, if there is more\nthan one active ASM database instance, the agent queries back multiple\nrows for each disk or disk group in all active instances.\nIf there is a situation in monitoring the attributes such as \nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP.Free_Percent, there are\nduplicated alerts by this type of situation.\n\nThe agent queries back only one record for each disk or disk group, and \navoids the duplicated alert for the situation.\n\nThe following attribute groups are impacted by this fix:\n\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISKGROUP\n\nDefect: 168967\nAbstract: FreeToMax return negative value. \nAdditional Information: The agent gets a negative value or over 100% on the\nfollowing attributes because the Maximum file size of an Oracle\ndata file is less than the real data file size:\n\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Free_To_Maximum\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACETEMP_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated\n\nDefect: 172392\nAbstract: CANNOT MERGE CUSTOM SQL FOR BASETABLE \nAdditional Information: Use the KRZ_CUSTOM_SQLXML environment variable \nto specify a customized\nkrzsql_custom.xml file where the new SQLInfo is defined and the agent\nuses SQLInfo from the customized sql xml file instead of the \ndefault krzsql.xml file. There is a new BaseTable tag in\nthe SQLInfo from version 6.3.1 and the new definition of\nBaseTable cannot overwrite the default definition in the krzsql.xml file.\n\n<SQLInfo ID=\n...\n</SQLText>\n<BaseTable QueryName=\"SampleTable1\" GrantName=\"SampleTable1\"/>\n</SQL>\n\nIf you do not grant all tables and views to the Oracle Database Extended agent \nuser in the krzgrant.sql file, error messages are displayed about ORA-00942\nbecause the agent checks the Oracle authority on the QueryName element \nwhile the agent runs continuously.\n\nThe error message about ORA-00942 can be avoided by using a customized\nsql xml file and copying the SQLInfo definition from the default krzsql.xml \nfile and replacing the QueryName and GrantName with 'dual'.\n\n<SQLInfo ID=\n...\n</SQLText>\n<BaseTable QueryName=\"dual\" GrantName=\"dual\"/>\n</SQL>\n\nDefect: 172695\nAbstract: KRZCLIENT LOG FILE LOOP AND OVERWRITE FIRST ONE \nAdditional Information: The RAS1 log file for the \nkrzstart or krzclient processes loops between 01, 02, and 03.

Use this value as the target of the\ntacmd updateAgent command. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t RZ\n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 063102000\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the updateAgent command is specified as \ntwo characters (rz), not three characters (krz).\n- The node (-n) for the updateAgent command is the managed system\nname of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated. The \ntarget node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.\n\n- The following error might occur with the updateAgent command on \nLinux and UNIX endpoints; however, the agent is successfully \nupdated. This error does not occur on Windows endpoints.\n\nKUICUA011I: Updating the rz agents.\nKUICUA015E: The updateAgent command did not complete because an\nerror occurred. Refer to the following error\nreturned from the server:\n\nThe monitoring server encountered an error while updating the\nmanaged system type.\n\nThe kuiras1.log file might provide more information about \nthis error. If you require further assistance to resolve the \nerror, contact IBM Software Support.\n\nA timeout occurred while waiting for an agent task to complete on\n{node name}.\n\nThe agent task did not complete within the configured \ntime out period.\n\nVerify that the target system is online. Increase the \ntime out value and try the operation again.\n\n\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nFix 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001 included changes to the agent\nsupport files that must be installed. If you have already\ninstalled these updates, there are no additional installation\nsteps. Otherwise, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \nto the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command to \nview the current version of the agent. You are required to log in \nto a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent\nversion. \n\nFor example:\nOn a UNIX system, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t rz\n\nOn a Windows system, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\ibm\\itm'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t RZ \n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n06.31.02.00\n\nNote:\nThe component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified \nas two characters (RZ), not three characters (KRZ).\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, use \nthe kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on Linux\nor UNIX systems to dump the component versions on each of the \nfollowing systems: Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktop. \n\nNote: \nThe kincinfo and cinfo command output examples in the sections\nthat follow show all components that can be updated. If you do\nnot have all of these components installed, components that \nare not installed are not displayed in the output of these commands. \n\n\nSample output for the cinfo command on a UNIX or Linux systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nTo validate that all components are installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n./cinfo\n\nThis command provides four options on the CINFO menu shown in\nthe example that follows.

Oracle Database Server is 10.1.0.2.\nERROR at line 1:\nORA-00942: table or view does not exist\nORA-06512: at line 128\n- Workaround: Run the krzgrant.sql script in 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-FP0001 to resolve\nthis error.\n\n- Problem: tacmd listsystems command does not display proper version\nfor offline agent's subnode.\nFor subnode e.g. RZ:HOSTNAME-INSTANCE-CONNECTION:RDB, version is\ndisplaying as 06.31.01.XX, Status is 'N'.\n- Workaround: Check the version from the root node of the agent to get the correct\nversion, for example, for INSTANCE:HOSTNAME:RZ, the version is displayed as \n06.31.01.00. \n\n- Problem: After upgrading to Fix Pack 2 and configuring the Oracle\nDatabase Extended agent silently, the agent cannot\nconnect to the database, which is specified by the\nKRZ_CONN_STR parameter in the silent configuration\nresponse file.\n- Workaround: The KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter specifies the connection\ntype. The Advanced type is required to configure a\ndatabase connection with the KRZ_CONN_STR\nconnection string. For example:\n\nKRZ_CONN_STR.connection=//host:port/service\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.connection=Advanced\n\nTo solve the problem, update the silent configuration\nresponse file to specify the KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter and\nreconfigure the agent instance silently. For example:\n\n# cat /tmp/silent_config.txt\n############ PRIMARY TEMS CONFIGURATION ############\nCMSCONNECT=YES\nHOSTNAME=tivp055.cn.ibm.com\nNETWORKPROTOCOL=ip.pipe\nIPPIPEPORTNUMBER=1918\n############ Database connection config ############\nINSTANCE=inst1\nKRZ_CONN_USERID=tivoli\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD=password\nKRZ_INSTANT_CLIENT_LIBPATH=/opt/IBM/oci\nKRZ_DYNAMIC_LISTENER=FALSE\n###\nKRZ_CONN_STR.asm=//tivx010:1521/+ASM\nKRZ_CONN_USERID.asm=sys\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD.asm=oracle\nKRZ_CONN_MODE.asm=SYSDBA\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.asm=Advanced\n\n# /opt/IBM/ITM/bin/itmcmd config -A -o inst1\n-p /tmp/silent_config.txt rz\n\n- Problem: The Oracle Database Extended agent reports the error\nmessage ORA-03135: connection lost contact and the\nsubnode that represents the monitored database\nconnection is still offline in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nafter the monitored database recovers to active status..\n- Workaround: The Oracle Database might disconnect all active connections\nand reject new connections under certain circumstances.\nAn example is when resources such as CPU are exhausted\nin the Oracle Server.\nTo solve the problem, ensure that the Oracle Database\nand Oracle Listener are open to the new connection and\nrestart the agent instance.\n\n- Problem: After you upgrade to V6.3.1 Fix Pack 2, the subnode ID\nis truncated from 25 characters to 24 characters. The\noriginal subnode with 25 characters changes to gray, and\nthe new subnode with 24 characters is displayed.\n- Workaround: This behavior is expected. In 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0001\nor later versions, the agent changed the maximum\nsubnode ID from 25 characters to 24 characters to avoid\nthe following problem, which is a known APAR for IBM\nTivoli Monitoring V6.2.2 Fix Pack 4: \"pure event cannot\nfire when subnode name length is equal to or greater\nthan 32 characters.\"\nTo avoid truncation of the subnode from 25 characters to\n24 characters, use one of the following two options:\n\nOption 1: Set the following variable to a value of 25 in\nthe agent environment variable files:\nKRZ_MAX_SUBNODE_ID_LENGTH=25. After you upgrade,\nthe default value is 24.\nNote:\n- On UNIX or Linux operating systems, the\nenvironment variable files include\ninstalldir/config/rz.ini and installdir/config/\nrz_instance.config.\n- On Windows operating systems, the environment\nvariable files include installdir\\TMAITM6\\\nKRZENV_instance (32-bit) or installdir\\\nTMAITM6_X64\\KRZENV_instance (64-bit).\n\nOption 2: Reduce the length of the database\nconnection name, agent instance name, or host name;\nor, see Changing default naming conventions for\ndatabase connections in the Installation and\nConfiguration Guide for the Oracle Database Extended\nagent for information.\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n==================================\nNone.\n\n\n9.0 Notices\n===========\nThis information was developed for products and services offered \nin the United States.

How do I use this tool? \n\nANSWER\nWpcollector is a command line tool that automates the collection of portal logs and configuration files. Using automated log collection early in the Case life cycle can greatly reduce the number of doc requests that are made by Support. \n\nWpcollector is delivered with WebSphere Portal beginning with the 7.0 release. If tracing is required for the problem scenario, you must manually enable traceStrings and recreate the problem PRIOR to running wpcollector. \n\nTo run wpcollector, please follow the steps, below:\n\n\n\n * If IBM Support has requested tracing, enable it as instructed by the L2 Support Engineer and then recreate the problem.

The Crypto profiles now have TLSv1.2 and 1.1 which will be enabled by default. This affects the protocol version included in the Client Hello when DataPower is acting as the SSL client.

The reason for this is due to the following: \n\n\"A trusted credential is special because the namespace credentials it stores must be usable at any time, not depending on any timestamp. This rules out SSO tickets like Kerberos tokens or SAP tokens as they will expire after a short time and will become unusable. A suitable trusted credential therefore usually is a pair consisting of a user name and a password. However, for SSO based authentication to IBM Cognos BI, there is no password available to the namespace that can be stored into the trusted credential.

Confirm that the Global Security Kit is installed and meets the minimum requirements\n    \n    The Global Security Kit (GSKit) is a required component for the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enablement within the IBM HTTP Server. Therefore, it is important to confirm that a supported version of the Global Security Kit is installed prior to enabling SSL.\n    \n    For a complete listing of IBM HTTP Server releases and corresponding Global Security Kit versions, click IBM HTTP Server: Global Security Kit (GSKit) supported versions [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21173214].\n    \n    \n    \n 2. Create a key database file and certificates needed to authenticate the Web server during an SSL handshake\n    \n    The iKeyman GUI, which is included within the IBM HTTP Server distribution, can be used to create a key database file (for example: key.kdb) needed to store personal server certificates required by the client browser during an SSL handshake.\n    \n    For quick information on how to create a key database file and personal server certificates, refer to the technote IKEYMAN, How do I...? [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21006430] \n    \n    More extensive information on using the iKeyman GUI to create key database files and certificates is located here:  * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v7.0 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc%2Finfo%2Fihs%2Fihs%2Fwelc_ikeymangui.html] \n     * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v8.0 [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc%2Finfo%2Fihs%2Fihs%2Fwelc_ikeymangui.html] \n     * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v8.5 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc/ihs/welc_ikeymangui.html] \n     * For releases of IBM HTTP Server v9.0 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.ihs.doc/ihs/welc_ikeymangui.html] \n       \n       \n    \n    \n 3. Enable SSL directives within the IBM HTTP Server's configuration file (httpd.conf)\n     1. Verify that the SSL modules are uncommented\n         * For Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae:\n           \n           \n           LoadModule ibm_ssl_module modules/mod_ibm_ssl.so [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21179559&amp;aid=1]\n           \n           \n         * For UNIX\u00ae platforms:\n           \n           \n           LoadModule ibm_ssl_module modules/mod_ibm_ssl.so [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21179559&amp;aid=2]\n           \n           \n        \n        \n     2. Create an SSL virtualhost stanza using the following examples and directives\n        \n        If you are enabling one Web site for SSL, and the hostname is the same as the one already defined in the Global Scope for non-SSL (port 80), you can enable SSL as follows. This virtualhost uses the default hostname defined by the ServerName directive in the Global Scope and the IP address associated with it.\n        \n        http://www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 https://www.mycompany.com (SSL) 192.168.1.102\n        \n        Example 1:\n        \n        Listen 80\n        ServerName www.mycompany.com\n        \n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        \n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs\"\n        DirectoryIndex index.html\n        \n        Listen 443\n        <VirtualHost :443>\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        SSLDisable\n        KeyFile \"c:/program files/ibm http server/key.kdb\"\n        SSLV2Timeout 100\n        SSLV3Timeout 1000 [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21179559&amp;aid=3]\n        \n        If you are enabling one Web site for SSL and the ServerName is different than the ServerName already defined in the Global Scope for non-SSL (port 80), you can enable SSL as follows. Both hostnames must be registered in DNS to a separate IP address, and both IP addresses must be configured on local network interface cards.\n        \n        http://www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 http://www.mycompany2.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.103 https://www.mycompany2.com (SSL) 192.168.1.103\n        \n        Example 2:\n        \n        Listen 80\n        ServerName www.mycompany.com\n        \n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        \n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs\"\n        DirectoryIndex index.html\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:80>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        Listen 443\n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        SSLDisable\n        KeyFile \"c:/program files/ibm http server/key.kdb\"\n        SSLV2Timeout 100\n        SSLV3Timeout 1000 \n        If you are enabling multiple Web sites for SSL, you can enable SSL as follows. All hostnames must be registered in DNS to a separate IP address. Also, all the IP addresses must be configured on a local network interface card. You must use the SSLServerCert directive to identify which personal server certificate in the key database file is passed to the client browser during the SSL handshake for each Web site. If the SSLServerCert directive is not defined, the IBM HTTP Server passes whatever certificate in the key database file is marked(*) as the \"default key\".\n        \n        For more information on why different IP addresses are required when enabling multiple Web sites for SSL: IP-Based Virtual Hosting must be used if configuring multiple SSL Virtual Host [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21045922]http://www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 https://www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 http://www.mycompany2.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.103 https://www.mycompany2.com (SSL) 192.168.1.103 http://www.mycompany3.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.104 https://www.mycompany3.com (SSL) 192.168.1.104\n        \n        Example 3:\n        \n        Listen 80\n        ServerName www.mycompany.com\n        \n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        \n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs\"\n        DirectoryIndex index.html\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:80>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.104:80>\n        ServerName www.mycompany3.com\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs3\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs3\"\n        DirectoryIndex index3.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        Listen 443\n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.102:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        SSLServerCert mycompany\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs\"\n        DirectoryIndex index.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        SSLServerCert mycompany2\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.104:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany3.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        SSLServerCert mycompany3\n        <Directory \"c:/Program Files/IBM HTTP Server/htdocs3\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        </Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:/program files/ibm http server/htdocs3\"\n        DirectoryIndex index3.html\n        </VirtualHost>\n        \n        SSLDisable\n        KeyFile \"c:/program files/ibm http server/key.kdb\"\n        SSLV2Timeout 100\n        SSLV3Timeout 1000 \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 4.

Service for these components is provided when and if required.\n   \n   \n * Apache Axis2\u2122 \n   Axis2 is an open source web services engine from the Apache Software Foundation and is used within CICS to provide the web service Java\u2122 engine for the Axis2 JVM server environment. Service for this component is provided when and if required.\n   \n   \n * WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile\n   Liberty fix packs are provided on a regular basis through the CICS TS APAR delivery process and provide an update mechanism to keep the embedded CICS Liberty runtime synchronized with the fix packs provided by WebSphere Application Server. Keeping current helps you resolve problems faster for 2 reasons:  * Liberty APAR fixes (known as ifixes) can only be delivered on the latest Liberty fix pack that has been supplied by the CICS APAR process. \n    * CICS APAR fixes can require other fixes such as WebSphere Liberty fix packs.\n   \n   \n   \n\nCICS Explorer and z/OS Explorer\nThe CICS Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java includes components from CICS for developing CICS Java applications. The CICS SDK for Servlet and JSP support includes Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Liberty API libraries, and automatically installs required components such as WebSphere Developer Toolkit (WDT).\" Service for these components is provided through the CICS Explorer fix pack process when and if required. \n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27048530&amp;aid=4] Back to Top \n\n\nUpdate recommendations\n\nRecommended Service Upgrade (RSU) \nIBM recommends that you install all RSU [http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/support/servicetest/] PTFs as preventive software maintenance for CICS TS. An RSU is a predefined collection of PTFs identified with a SOURCEID of RSUyymm, where yy indicates the last 2 digits of the year and mm indicates the month. [http://www-03.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/servicetst/]You can order an RSU [http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/servicetst/]from ShopzSeries [https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/ShopzSeries/ShopzSeries.jsp].\n\n\nEquinox and Apache Axis2\nThere is unlikely to be much maintenance for Equinox and Axis2. Service for these components is provided when and if required, meaning it will be on a case by case basis and in most cases this will be to resolve service requests.\n\n\nWebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile\nRefer to Updating Liberty profile for CICS TS and z/OS Connect EE to latest version [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21993579] for a list of APARs you will need to update CICS TS and z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition (EE) to the latest version of WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile. \n\n\nCICS Explorer\nIBM recommends that you upgrade to the latest release of CICS Explorer to obtain the most recent functionality and service.

<password>;\n * \n * \n * Changes the password of the currently connected user. Password must be double quoted.

The default password is blank. \n\nOne will have to edit the HSQLDB DataSource to enable it to connect to the database with the new password. \n\nA) One method is by encrypting the password and editing the HSQLDB DataSource to allow DSA connection. Use nci_crypt to encrypt the password - for example: \n\n * \n * \n * \n\n\nedit the file: \n\n * \n\n\nto alter the property: \n\n * \n\n\nfrom the default value of {aes}9C71E0F544E705326E2B5CBDFC54CE46 to the new encrypted password value - for example: \n\n * \n\n\nThis requires an ImpactServer restart to enable. \n\nB) An alternate method is to edit the DataSource via the normal Impact configuration GUI and provide the new password there. This alternate method has the advantage that one does not need to perform the encryption oneself, nor does one need to manually edit the configuration file and nor does one need to perform an ImpactServer restart to read up the new configuration into the memory resident database that is the ImpactServer."}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nWhen running the completeness report in Decision Center we sometimes get a StackOverflowError such as:\n\n     ...\n     Caused by: java.lang.StackOverflowError\n         at ilog.rules.validation.solver.IlcIntScalProd.extract(IlcIntScalProd.java:89)\n         at ilog.rules.validation.solver.IlcIntExpr.getPIntExp(IlcIntExpr.java:156)\n     ...\n\n", "answers": [{"text": "Adjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options \nIf this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes.

By resolving the memory constraints, the stack overflow can be resolved. \nCAUSE\nWhen a stack overflow occurs, the amount of stack space required by the program exceeds what is configured for the stack in the Java\u2122 Virtual Machine (JVM) process, or the native stack size configured by the operating system. \nSome applications require stacks that are larger than the default size; for example, a graphics-intensive Java program can require a larger stack, which may require an increase in the stack size to avoid StackOverflow.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nLook for either Out of Memory messages or java.lang.StackOverflow in the server logs. The process may continue to run after either of these messages are seen. \n\n\nIf a crash did occur, a javacore should have generated on IBM SDK. You will either see the signal as SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGABRT, or SIGBUS. Usually the current thread will indicate the following\n\n\n\n\npending=java.lang.StackOverflowError \nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&aid=1]Explanations and Solutions\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=2]Detailed Configuration Options \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nExplanations and Solutions \n\nInfinite Recursion \nIf an application is performing recursion, the maximum stack size can easily be reached and a Stack Overflow exception is thrown. The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. \n\nSome traits of recursion: \n- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat \n- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads \n- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) \n- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) \n- Repeated calls in native functions \n\nIncreasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. \n\nA thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). \n\nJIT/HotSpot Compiled Code \n\nThe JIT/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] \n * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]\n\n\n\nDepleted Native Stack \nIt is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. \n\nTo resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow. \n\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=3] Back to top \n\n[http://www.ibm.com/i/v14/rules/dotted_blue_rule_443.gif] \n\n \n\nDetailed Configuration Options \n\nAdjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options \nIf this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes.

In a majority of cases, this is the result of file handles being leaked by some part of the application. This technote explains how to collect output that identifies what file handles are in use at the time of the error condition.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\n\n\n\nDetermine Ulimits\n\nOn UNIX and Linux operating systems, the ulimit for the number of file handles can be configured, and it is usually set too low by default. Increasing this ulimit to 8000 is usually sufficient for normal runtime, but this depends on your applications and your file/socket usage. Additionally, file descriptor leaks can still occur even with a high value. \n\nDisplay the current soft limit:\nulimit -Sn\n\nDisplay the current hard limit:\nulimit -Hn\n\nOr capture a Javacore, the limit will be listed in that file under the name NOFILE:\nkill -3 PID\n\n\nPlease see the following document if you would like more information on where you can edit ulimits:\nGuidelines for setting ulimits (WebSphere Application Server)\nhttp://www.IBM.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413 [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413]\n\n\nOperating Systems \n\nWindows By default, Windows does not ship with a tool to debug this type of problem. Instead Microsoft provides a tool that you can download called Process Explorer [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653]. This tool identifies the open handles/files associated with the Java\u2122 process (but usually not sockets opened by the Winsock component) and determines which handles are still opened. These handles result in the \"Too many open files\" error message. \n\nTo display the handles, click on the Gear Icon [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&amp;aid=1] in the toolbar (or press CTRL+ H to toggle the handles view). The icon will change to the icon for DLL files (so you can toggle it back to the DLL view). \n\nIt is important that you change the Refresh Rate. Select View > Update Speed, and change it to 5 seconds. \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] \n\nThere is also another Microsoft utility called Handle that you can download from the following URL: \nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896655.aspx] \n\nThis tool is a command line version of Process Explorer. The URL above contains the usage instructions. \n\n\nAIX \nThe commands lsof and procfiles are usually the best commands to determine what files and sockets are opened.. \n\nlsof \nTo determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThis output does not give the actual file names to which the handles are open. It provides only the name of the file system (directory) in which they are contained. The lsof command indicates if the open file is associated with an open socket or a file. When it references a file, it identifies the file system and the inode, not the file name. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nprocfiles \nThe procfiles command does provide similar information, and also displays the full filenames loaded. It may not show sockets in use. \n\nprocfiles -n [PID] > procfiles.out \n\n\nOther commands (to display filenames that are opened) \n\nINODES and DF \ndf -kP filesystem_from_lsof | awk '{print $6}' | tail -1 \n>> Note the filesystem name \nfind filesystem_name -inum inode_from_lsof -print > filelist.out \n>> Shows the actual file name \n\nsvmon \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep pers (for JFS) \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep clnt (for JFS2, NFS) \n(this opens files in the format: filesystem_device:inode) \n\nUse the same procedure as above for finding the actual file name. \n\n\nLinux To determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThe output will provide you with all of the open files for the specified PID. You will be able to determine which files are opened and which files are growing over time. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\nAlternately you can list the contents of the file descriptors as a list of symbolic links in the following directory, where you replace PID with the process ID. This is especially useful if you don't have access to the lsof command: \n\nls -al /proc/PID/fd \n\n\nSolaris Run the following commands to monitor open file (socket) descriptors on Solaris: \n\npfiles \n/usr/proc/bin/pfiles [ PID ] > pfiles.out \n\nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.ou t \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nHP-UX \nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.out \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nHello,\n\nICO 2.5.0.2 is compatible with OpenStack kilo, is there a plan making it work with OpenStack Liberty/Mitika ?\n\nWould you share any information or link about the roadmap, please?\n\nThanks in advance.", "answers": [{"text": "The current release of IBM Cloud Orchestrator will continue to bundle IBM Cloud Manager with OpenStack (ICMO), while future IBM Cloud Orchestrator releases will no longer bundle ICMO, as it has been announced that ICMO is at the end of market (see reference document below).", "answer_start": "489"}], "id": "TRAIN_Q453"}], "context": " FLASH (ALERT)\n\nABSTRACT\n Cloud Orchestrator (ICO) continues to be a strategic solution for IBM \n\nCONTENT\nIBM Cloud Orchestrator continues to be a strategic solution for IBM in Hybrid Cloud management and will continue to be actively developed.

This should help address common issues with this component before calling IBM support and save you time. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe following are some examples of common JSP problems and some basic information on how to resolve them: \n\n * java.io.FileNotFoundException: JSPG0036E: Failed to find resource\n   If the browser displays a JSPG0036E: Failed to find resource message, the JSP processor cannot find the specified JSP page in the Web module, as shown below.\n   \n   java.io.FileNotFoundException: JSPG0036F: Failed to find /Tests/index.jsp\n   at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionProcessor.findWrapper (JSPExtensionProcessor.java:246)\n   at com.ibm.ws.jsp.webcontainerext.JSPExtensionProcessor.handleRequest (JSPExtentionProcessor.java:228)\n   ... \n   Take following steps to verify URL being requested order to debug this exception:\n   \n   To determine the URL of the installed application, you need to use the administrative console to view the configuration of a number of items. The format of the URL is as follows:\n   \n   http://host:port/context_root/resource_name \n   Finding <host>:<port>\n   When a Web module is installed, a virtual host is associated with it. To find the virtual host using the WebSphere Application Server administrative console:  1. Select Applications > Application type > WebSphere Enterprise Applications.\n       \n       \n    2. Select the application name to open the details page.\n       \n       In the Web module Properties section, click Virtual hosts.\n       \n       \n    3. Note the virtual hosts that are used by the specified application Web module.\n   \n   \n   To find the host and port numbers that are valid for the virtual host:  1. Select Environment > Virtual Hosts.\n       \n       \n    2. Choose the virtual host, and then under Additional Properties, click Host Aliases.\n       \n       \n    3. The list contains the host name and port combinations that can be used to access this virtual host. The host name column should contain values that are registered in a DNS server as a host name for the WebSphere Application Server. An asterisk (*) in the host column indicates that any name can be used. In this case, use the server host name.\n   \n   \n   Finding <context_root>\n   The context root is the Web application root and is used to identify the application in the URI. To find the context root:  1. In the WebSphere Application Server administrative console, click Applications > Application type > WebSphere Enterprise Applications.\n       \n       \n    2. Select the target application, then under Detail Properties, click View Deployment Descriptor.\n       \n       \n    3. Review the <context-root> tag for the specified Web module in the related deployment descriptor tag.\n   \n   \n   Finding <resource_name>\n   To find the initial file for the application (for example, index.jsp), you can look at the welcome file list in the Web deployment descriptor. As per J2EE specification, JSP files should reside under web module root or under sub directory other than META-INF and WEB-INF.\n   \n   For example:  * Web module root :\n      \n      install_root\\profiles\\profile_name\\installedApps<CELL>\\<EAR>\\<WAR> \n      \n   \n   In the preceding case, the index.jsp file should reside uner Web_module_root/Test directory. If not, than it explains this error message. \n   \n * JSP not reloading\n   If, after modifying and saving a JSP file, the change does not show up in the browser, you need to check the reload settings in the Web module configuration and the JSP runtime reload settings. For the JSPs, the Web container reloads a Web module only when the IBM extension reloadingEnabled in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file is set to true.\n   \n   The following is an example of web module reloading settings in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file:\n   \n   <webappext:WebAppExtension xmi:version=\"2.0\" xmlns:xmi=\"http://www.omg.org/XMI\" xmlns:webappext=\"webappext.xmi\" xmi:id=\"WebAppExtension_1109270589179\" reloadInterval=\"3\" reloadingEnabled=\"true\" fileServingEnabled=\"true\"> \n   Location of the ibm-web-ext.xmi file :\n   \n   install_root\\profiles\\profile_name\\config\\cells\\cell_name\n   \\applications\\<EAR>\\deployments\\app_name\\<WAR>\\WEB-INF\\ibm-web-ext.xmi \n   Configuring JSP runtime reloading:\n   You have the ability to modify the JSP processor behavior for different JSP stages (such as development, testing, or production environments). This done by configuring specific attributes in the IBM Web module extensions that affect the JSP runtime reload behavior.\n   \n   JSP files can be translated and compiled at runtime when the JSP file or its dependencies are modified. This is known as JSP reloading. JSP reloading is enabled through the reloadEnabled JSP engine parameter in the ibm-web-ext.xmi configuration file.\n   \n   The JSP engine settings are stored in the ibm-web.ext.xmi file, as shown \n   <jspAttributes xmi:id=\"JSPAttribute_1\" name=\"reloadEnabled\" value=\"true\"/>\n   <jspAttributes xmi:id=\"JSPAttribute_9\" name=\"reloadInterval\" value=\"3\"/> \n   \n * Encoding and internationalization issues\n   Encoding and internationalization problems usually showup as garbage characters in Web pages and input from user interpreted incorrectly. Double Byte Character Set (DBCS) character processing is a common issue for encoding problems. DBCS is used for languages such a Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, where a single byte is not sufficient to represent all characters in the alphabet. Proper coding and configuration usually resolves these problems. For JSP pages, page encoding is the character encoding in which the file is encoded. For JSP pages in standard syntax, the page encoding is determined from the following sources:  1. The pageEncoding attribute of the page directive of the page \n    2. The charset value of the contentType attribute of the page directive\n   \n   \n   If none of these is provided, ISO-8859-1 is used as the default page encoding.\n   \n   Page directive implementation in JSP code:\n   \n   <HTML>\n   <HEAD>\n   <%@ page language=\"java\" contentType=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" pageEncoding=\"ISO-8859-15\" %>\n   <META http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n   <TITLE>Receiving parameters</TITLE>\n   </HEAD>\n   <BODY>\n   <H1>\n   Your data is <%= request.getParameter(\"name\") %>\n   </H1>\n   </BODY>\n   </HTML> \n   The pageEncoding and contentType attributes determine the page character encoding of only the file that physically contains the page directive. \n   \n * java.lang.IllegalStateException\n   This exception is thrown when attempt is made to modify HttpServletResponse object after it has been committed.\n   \n   If you have written something in the response buffer, you cannot forward a page:\n   \n   [7/8/05 20:36:25:694 ART] 0000004f ServletWrappe E SRVE0068E: Could not invoke the service() method on servlet TestServlet.

RequestDispatcher.forward() or performing jsp:forward\n   \n   \n   Two other common variants of this exception are: \n   java.lang.IllegalStateException: Header already sent \n   One or more headers have been committed to the client, so you cannot set that header again. \n   java.lang.IllegalStateException: OutputStream already obtained \n   In case of JSP, the default output stream has always been created when the JSP has been translated to servlet. Creating and associating another output stream is the reason for this problem. The following piece of code will describe the reason for this error condition: \n   try\n   {\n   lStream = pResponse.getOutputStream();\n   lStream.write(lDocument);\n   lStream.flush();\n   }\n   catch (java.io.IOException ioe)\n   {\n   logger.error(\"Exception writing ... to page output stream.\");\n   }\n   finally\n   {\n   try\n   {\n   if (lStream != null)\n   {\n   lStream.close();\n   }\n   }\n   catch (java.io.IOException ioe)\n   {\n   logger.error(\"Exception closing page output stream.\");\n   }\n   } \n   Two output streams cannot be associated with one JSP file. \n   \n\nWhat to do next \nIf the preceding troubleshooting steps did not help solve your problem, see the MustGather [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21255205] for JSP problems.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "The SDA function for ITCAM for SOA 7.2 FP1 ifix 5 works for TEMS but IS NOT coded to work for TEPS.

This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. \n\nCAUSE\nThe DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. \n\nIt should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. The other examples listed below will have their own strong points to be considered depending on the problem scenario. \n\n \n\nSyslog: \n\n* The syslog protocol operates over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery - a fast fire and forget method. \n\nTo create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets \n\nConfigure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI: \n\n 1. Name the log target \n 2. Select Target Type of syslog \n 3. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target \n 4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514 \n 5. Take all other defaults\n\n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1]  \n\n \n\nUnder the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: \n\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] \n\n * \n * 6. Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain.\n\n\nSyslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. \n\n \n\nNFS:\nAll NFS limitations apply from file size and permission settings. This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. \n\n \n\nFile type: \n\nUsing a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]\nThis will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.\n\nThis is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load.\n\n\nHTTP service:\nFinally a clever method that may be used in some senarios would be an HTTP service on the device.\nUsing an HTTP service configured in the following way,\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] \n\nOnce the file type log is created in the logtemp:/// directory, a client browser or wget type client can easily retrieve the file from the device. \n\nThis is very useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions. \n\nThis is also removing the limitation of the device dropping the log event should it not be able to write the log event to the network. \n\nEach of the above methods are very useful and work better in some scenarios than others depending on the network, load, problem, and information needed. This is intended to be a guide to help you decide which method would be best for your scenario."}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: A vulnerability in the GSKit component of IBM MQ Appliance (CVE-2016-0201).

The sequence number is incremented during every change, upload, scan, etc. Every import contains data starting from the sequence number reported during the last successful import to the current sequence number. \n\nWhen the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created. Because of that, it might happen that the sequence number after the restoration is lower than the sequence number reported during the last successful import. In such case, the first import after the database restoration does not include any data. After that import, the sequence number is updated and the next import contains new data. Depending on your scan settings, you might need to wait some time for the import that contains new data. \n\nWhen the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created.\n\nData for the period from the last successful import before the restoration of the database until the restoration is never imported (obviously, as the data was removed by restoring the DB) and needs to be re-generated by re-running the scans if needed. \n\nData from DB restoration time until first successful import is also by default not imported (causing a gap).

This step-by-step technote guides DataPower Appliance users on how to configure DataPower MQ Manager Object to use SSL in mutual authentication mode. This technote assumes that MQ queue manager is configured with key database and its associted password file for using SSL connection with other MQ clients. If it is not configured yet, it has to be done first using the URL: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/e_ssl.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/e_ssl.htm] \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIn order to use this technote, you should have a working knowledge of how to setup and administer MQ Server in Windows, AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, or Linux environment. You should also have an understanding of how to configure DataPower MQ Manager Object that connects to remote WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (qmgr). This technote focuses on configuring DataPower MQ Client to use SSL in mutual authentication mode with Firmware Releases 3.8.2 and later fixpacks. Follow these steps to configure DataPower MQ Manager Object (mq-qm object) to access WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (Remote MQ Server) in SSL mutual authentication mode.\nWebSphere MQ configuration prerequisites\n\nThe following three steps are necessary to make sure that the SSL configurations for the Remote MQ Server is correctly working. Refer to IBM WebSphere MQ product manuals to configure MQ environment to work in SSL mutual authentication mode.\n\n\n 1. Configure WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (Remote MQ Server) to use SSL authentication (SSLCAUTH as \"required\") using URL: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/e_ssl.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/e_ssl.htm]. \n 2. Configure WebSphere MQ Client to use SSL authentication. \n 3. Verify that WebSphere MQ Client can PUT/GET message(s) using application programs such as amqsputc and amqsgetc with MQ Queue Manager in SSL mutual authentication mode.\n    \n\n\nGenerate self signed key/certificate \n 1. Generate the self signed key/certificate pair using the \"crypto tool\" from the DataPower device. \n 2.  Download the two files to your local machine. For the sake of illustration purpose, the names of the key and certificate files are defined as \"dpmqclient-privkey.pem\" and \"dpmqclient-sscert.pem\" respectively. \n 3. Assuming that openssl tool (www.openssl.org [http://www.openssl.org]) is installed in the local machine. With openssl tool, you can use the following command to create a \"pkcs12\" type key from the above key/certificate pair which are of PEM type. This step is necessary as MQ key database will not import key/certificate files created as PEM.\n    \n    openssl pkcs12 -export -out dpmqclient-key.p12-in dpmqclient-sscert.pem-inkey dpmqclient-privkey.pem-name ibmwebspheremqadmin\n    \n    Note the value associated with \"-name\" parameter. IBM WebSphereMQ client required a friendly label as \"ibmwebspheremq<userid>\" of the MQ client user. In this example, the user name is being used as \"admin\". This user must be used in the DataPower MQ Queue Manager object and it must also be an authorized user for both the DataPower MQ instance as well as for the remote WebSphere MQ Server. Please refer to Pages G58-62 in the 3.6.0-WebGui Guide for various fields as described in MQ Queue Manager configuration screen. Also note the following two fields with appropriate values which are required for the MQ Queue Manager object to connect the remote WebSphere MQ Server in SSL mode. \n\n *  SSL Key Repository: The key database file name \n   SSL Cipher Specification: TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US \n   \n\nTo import a personal certificate using \"iKeycmd\" GUI, use the following commands in your host machine where the WebSphere MQ Server/Client is running. \n * UNIX\n * \n * \n *  gsk7cmd -cert -import -file filename -pw password -type pkcs12 -target filename -target_pw password -target_type cms \n * \n * \n * Windows\n * \n * \n *  runmqckm -cert -import -file filename -pw password -type pkcs12 -target filename -target_pw password -target_type cms \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * -file \n * filenam \n * \n * \n * -pw \n * password\n * \n * \n * -type \n * pkcs12 \n * \n * \n * -target \n * filename\n * \n * \n * -target_pw \n * password\n * \n * \n * -target_type \n * cms\n * \n\n\n\nGenerate the new password file \n\nFollow these steps to generate the new password file. \n 1.  Start the iKeyman GUI using either the gsk7ikm command (on UNIX) or the strmqikm command (on Windows). \n 2.  From the Key Database File menu, click Open. The Open window displays. \n 3.  Click Key database type and select CMS (Certificate Management System). \n 4.  Click Browse to navigate to the directory that contains the key database files. \n 5.  Select the key database file in which you want to save the certificate, for example key.kdb. \n 6.  Click Open. The Password Prompt window displays. \n 7.  Type the password you set when you created the key database and click OK. \n 8.  The name of your key database file displays in the File Name field. The Personal Certificates menu will display both \"ibmwebspheremq<qmgr>\" and \"ibmwebspheremq<user>\" labels. \n 9.  In the WebSphere MQ Certificate key database, there is one certificate assigned to the queue manager or client. The certificate's Friendly Name attribute contains the string ibmwebspheremq followed in lower case by the queue manager name or the client logon ID. This Friendly Name value becomes the label of the certificate in the GSKit key database. Refer to Alter the Friendly Name (Label) of pkcs12 certificates for importing into GSKit [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21225160] if you want to alter the Friendly Name (Label) of pkcs12 certificates that are part of WebSphere MQ Certificate key database.

You can switch it back to HTTP. \n\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\nWhen Business Process Choreographer Explorer uses the default secure HTTPS protocol, any attempts to access Business Process Choreographer Explorer using HTTP are redirected to use HTTPS. If you need Business Process Choreographer Explorer to support insecure HTTP connections, you can use the unsecureExplorer.ant script to switch the protocol used from HTTPS to HTTP. \n\nAttention: It is not recommend to use the insecure HTTP protocol. Using HTTP for the Business Process Choreographer Explorer can open your organization to possible security problems.\n\nSwitching to HTTP\n\nIf you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer from HTTPS to use HTTP, complete the following actions: \n\n 1. Download the unsecureExplorer.ant script file, which is attached near the bottom of this page.\n    \n    \n 2. If you previously switched Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use HTTP, but are performing this task again because you are installing an interim fix, fix pack, or refresh pack that updated Business Process Choreographer Explorer has reverted it back to the default HTTPS protocol, you must first delete the old (invalid) backup EAR file before running the script.\n    \n     * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, delete the install_root/ProcessChoreographer/internal/bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file. \n     * On Microsoft Windows platforms, delete the\n       install_root\\ProcessChoreographer\\internal\\bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 3. Run the script to patch the bpcexplorer.ear file. In a network deployment environment, you must run the script on the deployment manager.  * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, enter the following command:\n       install_root/ws_ant.sh -f unsecureExplorer.ant \n     * On Windows platforms, enter the following command:\n       install_root\\ws_ant.bat -f unsecureExplorer.ant\n       Note: A backup copy of the original EAR file is created named bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 4. Deploy the patched bpcexplorer.ear file by updating the profile. For more information about updating profiles for an interim fix, see one of the following documents:  * For version 8.0.1.x: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21608414]. \n     * For version 8.5 and later: Profile update instructions for IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) interim fixes [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21637449].\n       \n       \n    \n    \n\nRemember: In the future, if you install an interim fix, fix pack, or refresh pack that updates the Business Process Choreographer Explorer, it will revert to using the default secure HTTPS protocol. If that happens and you still need the Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use the HTTP protocol, you must complete these steps again to re-enable the HTTP protocol. \n\n\n\nSwitching back to HTTPS \n\nIf you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer back from HTTP to HTTPS, complete the following actions:  1. Change to the directory where the backup EAR file is located.  * On Linux, UNIX-based and z/OS platforms, its location is \n       install_root/ProcessChoreographer/internal \n     * On Windows platforms, its location is \n       install_root\\ProcessChoreographer\\internal\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2. In that directory, copy or rename the backup EAR file bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear to bpcexplorer.ear and overwrite any existing copy.\n    \n    \n 3. Deploy the original HTTPS version by updating the profile.

Since trace logs can be quite verbose and include many unrelated errors, resetting the logs and then reproducing the problem issue can reduce the time required for log analysis for specific issues.\n\nANSWER\nSteps to enable tracing: \n\n\nEnable trace logging. \n\n 1. Log into the DASH. After logging in navigate to Console Settings [/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21632844&amp;aid=1] > Websphere Administrative Console. \n 2. Navigate to Troubleshooting -> Logs & Trace \n 3. Click on the Server1 -> Select Diagnostic Trace Service. Increase the Maximum Number of Historical Files from 1 to 10. \n 4. Click Apply, then select Change Log Detail Levels. \n 5. Click on Runtime tab to enable tracing for the DASH process that is currently running. Enabling tracing from the Runtime tab will keep tracing active until the next time the DASH server process is stopped. To make tracing persistent even after stopping and restarting the DASH server process click the Configuration tab instead. \n 6. Clear the trace string in the Groups box and replace it with the following:\n    \n    *=info: com.ibm.isc.*=all: com.ibm.isclite.*=all: com.ibm.iscportal.*=all: com.ibm.isclite.service.datastore.consoleproperties.*=INFO\n    \n    For the Connection manager (data provider related issues) you will want to enable all for the following components:\n    \n    *=info: com.ibm.isclite.rest.*=all:com.ibm.tivoli.conmgr.*=all \n 7. Click on the Apply button. \n 8. If you enabled tracing from the Configuration tab in step 4, then click the \"Save\" link that appears at the top of the page. (\"Save to master configuration\")\n\n\nOnce tracing is enabled, reproduce the DASH runtime issue. Note the time that the issue was reproduced so that the issue can be easily correlated with the trace log entries. \n\nRun the log collector program:\n\n\n 1. Change the directory to <JazzSM Home>/ui/bin \n 2. Run the following command:\n    \n    ./consoleLogCollector.sh or .bat\n    \n    Send us the console_logs.zip file located in <JazzSM Home>/ui directory\n\n\nand attach them to the associated Problem Management Record (PMR).

A coordinated update procedure should be followed when there is a need to change the user account and/or password. This procedure applies to FileNet Content Engine 4.x and above. \n\n * \n * Note: \n * \n * \n\n\nIf the same user account is also used as the CE Bootstrap user, the corresponding user in the BootstrapConfig.properties needs to change as well. For changing the GCD admin user/password in BootstrapConfig.properties specifically, refer to this documentation: \nhttp://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.p8.doc/admin/security/sec_how_change_bootstrap_pwd.htm [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.p8.doc/admin/security/sec_how_change_bootstrap_pwd.htm] \n\n\n1. Launch FEM and the application server's administrative console. \na. Login to FEM using the Directory Service account. \nb. Login to the application server administrative console with an administrator account. \n\nImportant: Do not close above two applications until you have completed step 5 below. \n\n\n2. Make LDAP account changes: \na. Change the password for an existing account on the LDAP server - Using LDAP interface, change the password for the CE Directory Service account. \nOR \nb. Create a new user account on the LDAP server for the CE Directory Service account. \n\n\n3. Add new user (if applicable), to FEM \nIf the bind user is also the CE admin user, then the bind user will need to be added to all the existing objects in the P8 domain. Please read Update object store with new users and groups [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/p8docs/v4r5m1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.p8.doc/admin/security/sec_how_update_os.htm] for instructions \n\n\n4.

Click on Change password check box > change to a new password > click OK. \n\nAt this point you will be presented a dialog box with following message: \n\u201cThese changes require the application server to be restarted. Please restart the application server to incorporate these changes\u201d \n\nclick OK > click OK \n\nImportant: Do not restart the application server until you have completed step 5 below. \n\n\n5. Change the user in the application server's directory configuration \n\n- For Websphere, in the WebSphere Administrative Console, go to Global Security > click on Configure under User Account Repository > Modify Bind Distinguished Name (DN) > Modify Bind Password > click OK and Save changes \n\n- For WebLogic go to Security Realms > myrealm > Providers > ldap provider and click on \"Provider Specific\" tab in WebLogic Admin Console. Change \"Principal\" and \"Credential\". \n\n- For JBoss go to <JBoss Home>\\server\\<CE Server>\\conf directory and edit \"login-config.xml\". \nFind \"FileNet\" application-policy and in login module change bindDN/bindCredential. \n\n\n6. Changing the CE Bootstrap user \n\nFor CE 4.5.x and above: \na. In the Configure Bootstrap Properties task, set the Bootstrap Operation property to Modify Existing. \nb. Confirm that the Bootstrapped EAR file property contains the path to the bootstrap file you need to edit. \nc. Change the Bootstrap user password. Use Configuration Manager's features to save and run the task. \nd. Run Configuration Manager's Deploy Application. \n\nFor CE 4.0: \nNote: This step is needed only if the GCD user name is the same as the Directory Service account. Note that the example below is for a Windows environment. \n\n- For WebSphere \na. Open command prompt window, go to folder where EAR file reside (it differs depending on CE version). For example, in CE 4.5.1, go to \"<CE Home> \\ tools \\ configure \\ profiles \\ <profile> \\ ear\" \nb. Backup Engine-ws.ear \nc. Execute the command below: \n\njava \u2013jar \u201cc:\\program files\\FileNet\\ContentEngine\\lib\\BootStrapConfig.jar\u201d \u2013e Engine-ws.ear --username <username> --password <password> \n\nd. Since the Engine-ws.ear file has been deployed in the WebSphere's installedApps path, the Bootstrap file need to be copied to the path manually.

The key to help confirm this is to increase the log level to debug.

For example, a reused connection would be attempted and found to already be closed out by something outside of DataPower\u00ae.\nAn example of this is explained here:\nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1]\n\nThere are a broad range of network errors that can trigger this to error. A packet trace is the key to capture the problem and confirm what type of failure is the cause. A log with event subscription of \"all\" \"debug\" will also help correlate and confirm the packet trace data.\n\nIn some cases, a simple work around to try is to lower the DataPower persistent timeout or disable persistent connections.

The memory for the third parameter was not handled properly.\nAnd accessing this parameter by other attribute group would result\ninto crash.\n\nAPAR: IJ00815\nAbstract: Device Detail attribute AUTOGROWTH behaviour not in sync\nwith SQL Server. \nAdditional Information: In case when data file autogrowth was disabled\nand max-size was set to unlimited, then the incorrect values were\ndisplayed for filegroup detail attribute(Max Growth Size) and device\ndetail attribute(Growth).\n\nAPAR: IJ01540\nAbstract: False alerts are being generated as default value \"Not\nCollected\" for \"Database Space Pct Used\" attribute is not correctly\nconverted before sending to TEPS.\nAdditional Information: Situations having default value\n[ Not Collected (-1 ) ] in formula were not getting evaluated correctly\nfor some database detail attributes. However, the data was shown\ncorrectly as \u2018Not Collected\u2019 on the portal.\n\nAPAR: IJ05451 \nAbstract: ITCAM SQL Server Agent's collector process crashes when using\nSQL Server Native Client 10.0 or SQL Server Native Client 11.0 as\nODBC driver.\nAdditional Information: Collector was not able to handle all possible values\nreturned by ODBC when using SQL Server Native Client 10.0 and SQL Server\nNative Client 11.0 causing it to crash.\n\n2.2 DEFECTS:\n-----------------\nDEFECT: 170986\nAbstract: Memory leak in Table Detail attribute group. \nAdditional Information: Memory leak observed in Table Detail attribute\ngroup because incorrect de-allocation handling. \n\nDEFECT: 170987\nAbstract: Crash observed in Availability group details attribute group\nand Table detail attribute group\nAdditional Information: Crash observed in Availability group details\nattribute group and in Table detail attribute group for the wrong\nusage of iterator after erase. Issue happened because an attempt to\nincrement the iterator was made after the iterator was deleted through\nerase function. \n\nDEFECT: 170993\nAbstract: intial size > max size gives incorrect values\nAdditional Information: If a database was created with restricted growth\nand then modifed the initial size of the database file to a value\ngreater than it's maxsize, then the value of maxsize was not updated\ncorrectly (ideally in this case maxsize should become equal to initial\nsize). As a result, query to SQL Server returned false value for\nmaxsize due to which incorrect values were getting displayed on portal\nfor attributes in Database Detail, Device Detail and Filegroup Detail\nattribute groups.\n\nDEFECT: 170994\nAbstract: Incorrect value displayed for Database Detail attributes\nwhen autogrowth disabled and data freespace > drive freespace.\nAdditional Information: In cases when data file autogrowth was disabled\nand data freespace was greater than device freespace then incorrect\nvalue were seen for some attributes(Data Freespace , Aggregate Database\nFreespace , Database Space pct used , Aggregate Database Freespace pct,\nDatabase max growth size). \n\nDEFECT: 171127\nAbstract: Add tolerance support for SQL Server 2017.\nAdditional Information: Added support for SQL Server 2017 version.\n\nDEFECT: 171244\nAbstract: Spelling mistake in agent configuration panel.\nAdditional Information: Few spelling mistakes in agent configuration\npanel were corrected.\n\nDEFECT: 171318\nAbstract: Usage of KOQ_ODBC_DRIVER variable in pre-req while making\nsql server connection.\nAdditional Information: During pre-requisite check, the value of\n\u2018Driver\u2019 was hardcoded to \u2018SQL Server\u2018. While later on, for collecting\ndata value for 'Driver\u2019 was picked from \u2018KOQ_ODBC_DRIVER\u2019 variable.\nDue to this, issue was seen during pre-requiste connection but later\non data was being collected successfully.\n\nDEFECT: 171379\nAbstract: High Severity vulnerabilities are resolved to avoid undefined\nbehaviour of the agent.\nAdditional Information: Removed the high severity errors in the code,\ndetected in CPPCheck tool.\n\nDEFECT: 171785\nAbstract: DBD_TEMP rename failed with error [32]\nAdditional Information: Renaming of DBD_TEMP to DBD_PREV files was\nfailing with Error 32 (The process cannot access the file because it\nis being used by another process)because DBD_TEMP file handle was\ntaking time to close. \n\nDEFECT: 171979\nAbstract: Incorrect value is being sent when query is failed in SRV1\ncursor.\nAdditional Information: Zero value was being sent when query fails in\nSRV1 cursor which was incorrect. Zero is a meaningful value which does\nnot indicate failure.\n\nDEFECT: 171981\nAbstract: Not Collected value is frequently sent since database\ndetail collection is not getting completed in 45 seconds.\nAdditional Information: When database detail collection took more\nthan 45 seconds for collection, Not collected values were sent which\nresulted into triggering of situation.\n\nDEFECT: 172173\nAbstract: Environment setting for COLL_DBCC_NO_LOCK was not taking\neffect. Similar issue was seen with COLL_MONITOR_ALL_DATABASES.\nAdditional Information: Values were getting overwritten for above two\nvariables, hence queries were running without NoLock hint and monitoring\nof all database setting was not working as expected.\n\nDEFECT: 173699\nAbstract: No data get collected for server summary attribute group.\nAdditional Information: SRV3,one of the pre-cursor of server summary\nattribute group, was failing as its query was executed with (null)\noption. Hence no data was collected for server summary attribute group.\n\nDEFECT: 174076\nAbstract: MSSQLQA: Sometime server detail data is not getting displayed\non portal.\nAdditional Information: SRV3, one of the pre-cursor of server summary\nattribute group, was failing as its query was executed with (null)\noption. Hence sometimes server detail data was not getting displayed\non portal.\n\nDEFECT: 174077\nAbstract: crypted SQL password in log file.\nAdditional Information: Encrypted password value in logfile is \nreplaced with fixed length string to avoid security breach.\n\nDEFECT: 174420\nAbstract: Last Statistics Query execution failing for table details\nattribute group.\nAdditional Information: Due to query failure,table detail data was\ncollected only for the first time. From second collection onwards,\nnew data was not collected & portal always showed the data collected\nduring first collection.\n\nDEFECT: 175117\nAbstract: Table detail attribute group query was failing for syntax error\nat where clause and returned null\nAdditional Information: The query which gets executed while include/exclude\ndatabases is on, was containing two consecutive \"where\" and hence \nwas failing. This issue is seen with SQL Server 2014 and above versions. \n\nDEFECT: 175120\nAbstract: Data is not collected properly with the non default SQL\nODBC driver.\nAdditional Information: Due to incorrect size calculated for some\ndata types, either query\u2019s result set processing was failing or the\ndata was getting truncated.

The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\nBefore installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment\nvariable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory.\n\nFor example:\n> CANDLEHOME=/opt/IBM/ITM\n> export CANDLEHOME\n\n- Refer to section 7.0 entitled \"Known problems and workarounds\"\nbefore installation.\n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n----------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory\non the system that contains the agent code to be updated. For\nthe purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the \nsupported platforms.\n\n3. Use the \"itmpatch\" command to install the fix for that agent\nplatform. For more information on the \"itmpatch\" command, see\nsection 6.2.\n\nOn Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to\n<TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001, the install command is:\n\nFor 32 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME>\n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_winnt_tema_if0001.cab\n\nFor 64 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_wix64_tema_if0001.cab\n\nNote : Use \"itmpatch\" command from <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\ \ntemporary directory.\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n-----------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory\non the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system. For the\npurpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully\nqualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the \nsupported platforms.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more\ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>/6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>/6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nOn Windows systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to \nbe added to the depot. \n\n4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the\n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see \"IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring Command Reference\".\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063113001\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063113001\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is \nspecified as two characters (oq), not three characters (koq).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the\nmanaged system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be\nupdated.\nThe target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is always\nan OS agent.\n\n5. To check if Remote Agent Update is SUCCESS/INPROGRESS/FAILED use the command \n>tacmd getDeployStatus -g <transaction id>\n\nwhere transaction id is the id provided after updateAgent command.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli \nEnterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nServers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (koq_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Desktop using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an \nextract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM,\nwith the necessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) script to launch either \nGUI installation or silent installation of the application \nsupport files. \n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one\nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version \nof the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, \n6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002 at \nhttp://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]\nfor download and installation instructions.\n\n2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to \na java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running \nthe itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. \n\nGUI installation option\n------------------------\nThe GUI can be started by using one of the following commands\nfrom within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> ./itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the\n\"bin\" directory where Java(R) is installed.\nThe location of Java on your system might\nvary.\n\nWhen prompted by the Application Support Installer for the \ninstallable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not\nthe component directory. The installer can install updates for \nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nSilent installation option\n--------------------------\nTo use the silent installation option, use one of the following\ncommands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is \nlocated. \n\nNote: Agent support upgrade for IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 \nor above on Linux, zLinux, Solaris and windows operating systems \nrequires the following files contained in interim fix \n6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002. This is applicable to both GUI and \nsilent installation option of agent support upgrade.\n- Linux: setupLinux.bin\n- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin\n- Solaris: setupSolaris.bin\n- Windows: setupwin32.exe\n\nFollow the installation instructions contained in the\n\"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002.README\".\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> ./itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-r <response file> - Required. Customized response file name.\nThe default response file \"response.txt\" in\nthe CD-ROM directory can be copied and\nmodified as per your environment.\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the\n\"bin\" directory where Java(R) is installed.\nThe location of Java on your system might\nvary.\n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer \nasks for the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components\nyou want to add application support to.\nFor this fix, the check boxes should be set as follows:\n\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server(TEMS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server(TEPS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client(TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the\nMicrosoft SQL Server 06.31.13.01 support to complete the\ninstallation.\n\nNote: When support is installed using CLI or GUI for any of the\nabove Tivoli Monitoring components, they are restarted. \n\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Browser was running when the update was installed, it\nmust be restarted.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n=======================================\nAny existing Microsoft SQL Server Agent instances should be restarted\nafter the installation of this fix.\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n--------------------------------------------------\nFix (6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001) includes changes to the agent\nbaroc files which need to be reinstalled. If you have already\ninstalled these baroc files, there are no additional installation\nsteps. If not, refer to IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Installation\nand Setup Guide under \"Installing monitoring agent baroc files\non the event server\" in \"Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise\nConsole Event Synchronization\" section for more information.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using \"itmpatch\" command\n----------------------------------------------------\nThe \"itmpatch\" command has the following syntax.\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be \ninstalled\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>/bin/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere:\n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring \ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where\nthe fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive\nletter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the \"tacmd\" command\nto view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer prior to viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis '/opt/IBM/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t OQ\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t OQ \n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd \"listSystems\" command is \nspecified as two characters (OQ), not three characters (KOQ).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n06.31.13.01.\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthe agent was successfully updated.\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is \n06.31.13.01.\n\n2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use \nthe \"kincinfo\" command on Windows systems or the \"cinfo\" command\non Linux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the \nversions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli \nEnterprise Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop systems after this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote: The displayed build date and installation date might not \nbe accurate. This is known problem.\n\nOn UNIX or Linux systems:\n-------------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n./cinfo -i\n\nOn Windows systems:\n-------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\nFor example:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\InstallITM\\kincinfo -i\n\nC:\\Users\\Administrator>kincinfo -i\n*********** Thursday, May 10, 2018 04:36:22 PM ************\nUser : Administrator Group : NA\nHost Name : HJS497-MSQL-T-1 Installer : Ver: 063007000\nCandleHome : C:\\IBM\\ITM\nInstallitm : C:\\IBM\\ITM\\InstallITM\n*************************************************************\n...Product Inventory\nOQ TEMS App Support/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.01 Build: 81136\n\nOQ TEPS App Support/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.01 Build: 81136\n\nOQ TEPB App Support/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.00 Build: 71541\n\nOQ TEPD App Support/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.01 Build: 81136\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n==================================\nAbstract: itmpatch command fails during upgrade\nProblem: When itmpatch command is executed, it fails while upgrading\nagent fix pack.

Further investigation may reveal a \"Failed to create a thread:\" message within the generated javacore which would indicate a native out of memory issue has been encountered. The cause of the problem may be an insufficient ulimit setting. While this type of issue can occur on any level of Linux, or AIX, the issue is most likely to be seen in systems running multiple instances of WebSphere Application Server using one userid. The following will outline how to identify if a process ulimit is the culprit and what WebSphere Application Server Support recommends to fix the case. \n\nSYMPTOM\nAn out of memory Dump Event such as: \n\n\"systhrow\" (00040000) Detail \"java/lang/OutOfMemoryError\"\n\"Failed to create a thread: retVal -1073741830, errno 11\" received\n\nNote: This detailed message will appear only in javacores.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nWhen using WebSphere Application Server, ulimits can be set to fix or tune around a number of problems. For more on how to set a ulimit refer to the \"Guidelines for setting ulimits [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413]\" Technote which goes into detail on setting different ulimits on various operating systems and the difference between the soft and hard limit. This article is concerned particularly with the \"-u\" ulimit or \"nproc\" limit on Linux, the ulimit - r on AIX which affects the number of threads allowed for a single user process running WebSphere Application Server. \n\nThe AIX issue is less commonly seen as it limits then number of threads for a process but is seen in application servers with very large thread pools, This is becoming more common in 64bit addressing JVMs running complex applications. WebSphere Application support recommends setting the ulimit -r ulimited on AIX.\n\nThe nproc limit usually only counts processes on a server towards determining this number. Linux systems running WebSphere Application Server are a particular case. The nproc limit on Linux counts the number of threads within all processes that can exist for a given user. To determine the ulimit settings of a WebSphere Application Server process running on Linux refer to \"How to determine the ulimit settings of a running WebSphere Application Server process on Linux [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21407889]\".\n\nUser Limits (in bytes except for NOFILE and NPROC) \n\ntype soft limit hard limit RLIMIT_AS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CORE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CPU unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_DATA unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_FSIZE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_LOCKS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_MEMLOCK 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NOFILE 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NPROC 131072 131072 \n\nFor most cases of older versions of Linux this value will be defaulted to around 2048. For out of the box Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 the default value for nproc will be set to 1024. This low default setting for larger systems will not allow for enough threads in all processes. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support recommends setting the ulimit -u or nproc to a value of 131072 when running on Linux to safely account for all the forked threads within processes that could be created. \n\nBy using this recommended value a sufficient number of threads in all processes will be allowed and will not be a limiting factor for the environment. Increasing the limit to the suggested value should have no negative impact. When the number of threads in all processes reaches the -u ulimit, an out of memory error message will be thrown. This issue can be avoided by increasing this limit. Be aware that if the number of threads/processes reaches the recommended number of 131072 or close, the issue may be deeper and continuing to increase the -u ulimit will only prove to be a temporary fix. \n\nOnce the ulimit is increased, the WebSphere Application Server will need to be restarted to use the \nnew setting. In the case of WebSphere Application Server ND, the nodeagent and the servers on the nodes will need to be restarted."}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "My SystemOut.log is overfilled by messages SECJ0371W (LTPA token expired).

As of DB2\u00ae Universal Database\u2122 (DB2 UDB) Version 8 fixpak 7 (equivalent to DB2 UDB Version 8.2), DB2 is using ICC on most platforms.\n\nCustomers who need to operate in an environment that is compliant with FIPS 140-2 federal standard should take into account the releases of ICC that are shipped by DB2 on different platforms and the compliance status of those releases with FIPS 140.2.\n\nFollowing is a list of platforms on which DB2 is using ICC for encryption of data flowing between clients and servers:\n\nDB2 V8 Fixpak 7 through DB2 Fixpak 11: \nICC Version 1.2.2 on platforms:\nAIX 32 bit\nHP-UX PA-RISC 32 bit\nICC Version 1.2.1 on platforms: \nAIX 64 bit\nHP-UX PA-RISC 64 bit\nHP-UX IA64\nLinux x86, Linux x86-64, Linux IA64\nLinux for zSeries\nLinux for POWER\nWindows x86 and IA64\nSolaris SPARC 64 bit\nICC Version 1.3.9 on platforms:\nSolaris x86-64 (DB2 V8.2 GA)\n\nDB2 V8 Fixpak 12 and later: \nICC Version 1.4.1 on platforms \nAIX\nHP-UX PA-RISC\nLinux x86 and x86-64\nLinux for zSeries\nLinux for POWER\nWindows x86 and x86-64\nSolaris SPARC\nICC Version 1.3.9 on platforms \nHP-UX IA64\nLinux IA64\nWindows IA64\n\nSummary of known problems encountered in ICC 1.2.1/1.2.2:\nThere are a number of issues with DB2 and the ICC encryption libraries at levels prior to 1.3.9. The known problems are: \n\n\n 1. Severe performance problems where processes seem to hang, or take several minutes to run. \n 2. A bug in ICC code causes it to communicate with the OpenSSL EGD (Entropy Gathering Daemon) which under certain circumstances could hang \n 3. ICC symbols have not been namespaced and DB2 can end up with symbol collisions with OpenSSL code. This can also happen when multiple versions of ICC are used within the same process.\n\n\nDB2 Version 8 Fixpak 12 and later incorporates IBM Crypto for C (ICC) version 1.3.9 or 1.4.1 cryptographic module which fixes these problems. \n\n \n\nNote: The latest status of ICC conformance with FIPS 140-2 standard can be obtained by referring to http://www.ibm.com/security/standards/st_evaluations.shtml [http://www.ibm.com/security/standards/st_evaluations.shtml]\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n FIPS PUB 140-2 [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf]"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "\n\nAfter installing IBM OMEGAMON for Messaging on z/OS 07.05.00, I receive the following ABEND after submitting PARMGEN Job KCIJPALO:\n\n      JOB02175  IEC141I 013-18,IGG0191B,U600861X,KMCJPALR,RKPDIN,600D,ISMS01,  083\n         083             HSYS.S002.OMGNEW.TKANPAR(KMCPDICT)\n     JOB02175  IEA995I SYMPTOM DUMP OUTPUT  085\n         085             SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE=013  REASON CODE=00000018\n         085              TIME=07.41.33  SEQ=00630  CPU=0000  ASID=004C\n         085              PSW AT TIME OF ERROR  075C1000   80E9E456  ILC 2  INTC 0D\n         085                NO ACTIVE MODULE FOUND\n         085                NAME=UNKNOWN\n         085                DATA AT PSW  00E9E450 - 4100302C  0A0D010D  A7E5014B\n         085                AR/GR 0: 009FF028/00E9E760   1: 00000000/A4013000\n         085                      2: 00000000/00081CB8   3: 00000000/00E9E734\n         085                      4: 00000000/009B1410   5: 00000000/009B17A4\n         085                      6: 00000000/009B174C   7: 00000000/009B17A4\n         085                      8: 00000000/009B176C   9: 00000000/00000080\n         085                      A: 00000000/00F20E10   B: 00000000/009B10FC\n         085                      C: 00000000/00000008   D: 00000000/00000000\n         085                      E: 00000000/80E9DCB4   F: 00000000/00000018\n         085              END OF SYMPTOM DUMP\n\nWhat is the cause of this?", "answers": [{"text": "Starting with V7.5, IBM OMEGAMON for Messaging on z/OS no longer delivers the component called WebSphere MQ Configuration Agent, referred to as MQ Configuration in the rest of this document, because there are other recommended ways to configure IBM MQ.", "answer_start": "34"}], "id": "TRAIN_Q103"}], "context": " PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION\n\nABSTRACT\n Starting with V7.5, IBM OMEGAMON for Messaging on z/OS no longer delivers the component called WebSphere MQ Configuration Agent, referred to as MQ Configuration in the rest of this document, because there are other recommended ways to configure IBM MQ. It is stabilized in the previous V7.3 release, but MQ Configuration will be supported as long as V7.3 is in support. The components in V7.5 are the IBM MQ Monitoring Agent and the IBM Integration Bus Monitoring Agent, both of which have enhancements in V7.5 that address monitoring requirements you may have. You can upgrade your OMEGAMON for Messaging monitoring components to V7.5 while using the previous release of MQ Configuration. \n\nWhether or not you want to continue using MQ Configuration when you install and configure OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5, there may be steps you need to take, so please review this document prior to installing and configuring V7.5. \n\nCONTENT\nFirst, please determine whether you have previously installed and configured the MQ Configuration component. If you have not done so previously, there is no need for you to consider the rest of this document. For this determination, please examine the following: \n\n\n\u00b7 SMP/E: Are the FMIDs for MQ Configuration installed? The FMIDs are HKMC730 and HKCF730, or HKMC710 and HKCF710 if you are using the V7.1 level. \n\u00b7 PARMGEN: In your PARMGEN configuration for each runtime environment, does the \u201cInclude Products in this PARMGEN RTE panel (KCIP@PGI)\u201d (under step \u201c1 KCIJPCFG Set-up/Refresh PARMGEN work environment\u201d navigation from the PARAMETER GENERATOR (PARMGEN) WORKFLOW - PRIMARY OPTION MENU), have the line for \u201cKMC OMEGAMON for Messaging \u2013 WebSphere MQ Configuration\u201d selected for configuration in the environment? \n\nIf the answers are \u201cyes\u201d to both of the above questions, then you do need to continue with the following general steps, which are documented in detail below: \n\n1) Determine whether there are any users of MQ Configuration in your environment. There are many cases in which the MQ Configuration component is installed and configured in PARMGEN, but no one is actually using it. It is important to determine this in order to decide which step to take next.\n\n2) If you do not have users of MQ Configuration, or you want to remove it anyway, there may be steps required when you are installing and configuring OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 especially if you previously configured a shared agent address space for MQ monitoring (KMQ) and MQ configuration (KMC) agents. \n\n3) If you do have users of MQ Configuration and want to continue supporting that usage, you need to follow recommendations when you are installing and configuring OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 upgraded products.\n\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1) Suggested ways to determine whether there are any users of MQ Configuration:\n\na. In the Tivoli Enterprise Portal (TEP), using an administrator user ID, click Edit->Administer Users to check whether any users or groups have access to the Configuration navigator view. For users and/or groups that have been configured for TEP, check the Navigator Views tab to see if any of them have \u201cConfiguration\u201d in their Assigned Views. If no one is allowed access to the Configuration navigator, then they are not using MQ Configuration feature. \n\nb. Another item to check in Administer Users is whether any user or group has the Permissions tab showing that View or Modify permission has been authorized for WebSphere MQ Configuration Authorities \u201cConfigure\u201d authority. Some user or group should have permission to use this feature if it is used by anyone. \n\nc. Check whether there are configured names that reflect queue managers in your environment. Click on the Configuration navigator in the view drop-down list in the Navigator pane, then click on Defined View on the left. In the middle Defined Tree pane on the workspace, expand the various \u201c+\u201d items, and with the help of someone who knows MQ queue managers in your environment, see if any of the expanded items reflect queue managers actually in your environment. There will be default and example items shipped with the product, but you are looking for names reflecting MQ at your site. If there are no names that reflect queue managers in your environment, then no one is using MQ Configuration.\n\nd. If it appears that there is usage of MQ Configuration, it would still be good to check with MQ users at your site to see if they actually require it. Perhaps they have experimented with it but do not actually use it regularly. If the OMEGAMON feature for MQ Configuration is not absolutely required in your environment, the recommendation would be to review all the ways that the IBM MQ product offers to configure and administer MQ, some of which are new in recent releases. Also, remember that the OMEGAMON MQ Monitoring agent offers the Take Action facility to issue any MQSC configuration command if the user is authorized.\n\n\n2) If there are no users of MQ Configuration, or you want to remove it anyway: \n\na. If you use a Serverpac that contains the upgraded OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 components to install, the MQ Configuration FMIDs (HKMC730 and HKCF730) are not installed because they are not included in the Serverpac. However, depending on your previous configuration, the missing MQ Configuration component could cause unexpected results in your LPAR runtime environment (RTE), so check and act on the following items prior to installation and configuration of OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5:\n\n1. If your Hub TEMS is configured on the z/OS platform and there are RKCF* DDNAME statements in your existing Hub TEMS started task JCL, update the TEMS started task JCL to remove those RKCF* DDNAME statements.\n\n2. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, make sure that the owner of that address space is the MQ Monitoring agent. For the MQ Monitoring agent to be the owner, the related PARMGEN LPAR RTE profile parameters for OMEGAMON for Messaging components may need adjusting, as depicted in the following example before and after settings:\n\nBefore (MQ Configuration owns the Agent address space called OMEGMQ):\nISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) \nCommand ===> \nKMC_AGT_STC OMEGMQ\nKMC_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d\nKMQ_AGT_STC \u201c\u201d\nKMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER OMEGMQ\n\nAfter (MQ Monitoring owns the Agent address space called OMEGMQ): \nISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) \nCommand ===>\nKMQ_AGT_STC OMEGMQ\nKMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d \n\nTip: Please review the SMPE06 upgrade scenario [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe06_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] in the OMEGAMON Shared Knowledge Center as part of deploying these changes. You can use the refreshed OMEGMQ OMEGAMON for Messaging \u2013 KMQ Agent-only address space in the RTE\u2019s W/RKANSAMU dataset for refreshing the original shared address space in your system procedure library. The only delta would be the RKMCAPLA DDNAME, which can be staged for removal.\n\nb. If you install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 as a CBPDO into an existing SMP/E CSI, the MQ Configuration FMIDs will remain installed, but since you are not using MQ Configuration, it is recommended you follow these steps:\n\n1. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, make sure that the owner of that address space is the MQ Monitoring agent. See item a.2 above for more details.\n\n2. In the \u201cInclude Products in this PARMGEN RTE panel (KCIP@PGI)\u201d (under step \u201c1 KCIJPCFG Set-up/Refresh PARMGEN work environment\u201d navigation from the PARAMETER GENERATOR (PARMGEN) WORKFLOW - PRIMARY OPTION MENU), deselect the line with \u201cKMC OMEGAMON for Messaging \u2013 WebSphere MQ Configuration\u201d so that it will be removed from the runtime environment (RTE) during reconfiguration/upgrade of the RTE. Follow one of the SMPEnn upgrade scenarios [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe04_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] documented in the OMEGAMON Shared Knowledge Center. \n\nTip: Prior to upgrading the RTE, you also have the option to SMP/E delete the HKMC730 and HKCF730 FMIDs from the existing CSI. When you start the PARMGEN configuration phase of the upgrade, the inexistence of these deleted FMIDs is PARMGEN\u2019s trigger to delete the product from the RTE upon reconfiguration following any of the SMPEnn upgrade scenarios (SMPE04 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe04_parmgenref.htm?pos=2], SMPE05 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe05_parmgenref.htm?pos=2] or SMPE06 [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAUBV/com.ibm.omegamon_share.doc_6.3.0.2/parmgenref/smpe06_parmgenref.htm?pos=2]). \n\n\n3) If there are users of MQ Configuration, and you want to continue supporting that usage: \n\na. It is highly recommended that you install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 as a CBPDO into the existing SMP/E CSI so that MQ Configuration remains available. If you do this, there are no other steps required, however, the following step is also highly recommended: \n\n1. If MQ Configuration (KMC) and MQ Monitoring (KMQ) agents are running in a shared agent address space, separate them into their own address spaces, since they will be running at different product levels. For this, the related PARMGEN LPAR RTE profile parameters for OMEGAMON for Messaging components may need adjusting to be like the following example in which MQ Configuration is running in an address space called OMEGMC and MQ Monitoring is running in an address space called OMEGMQ:\n\nISREDDE2 %RTE_PLIB_HILEV%.%RTE_NAME%.WCONFIG(%RTE_NAME%) \nCommand ===> \nKMC_AGT_STC OMEGMC\nKMC_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d\nKMQ_AGT_STC OMEGMQ\nKMQ_AGT_STC_OWNER \u201c\u201d\n\nb. If you were to install OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 in a Serverpac, you would need to retain your old SMP/E CSI and maintain a separate PARMGEN runtime environment in order to use MQ Configuration separately. This may be acceptable to you if you already separate MQ Configuration from the rest of your monitoring infrastructure, with its own Hub TEMS, etc. In this case, for the configuration that will contain OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5, please see item 2 above, steps a.1 and a.2 in case they would apply to that particular configuration.\n\nc. OMEGAMON for Messaging V7.5 application support does not include application support for the MQ Configuration component. If you need to re-install application support for MQ Configuration for any reason, you should use the latest V7.3 level of application support.

No update is required for \"thin client\" computers. You must upgrade all thick clients and servers to the same IBM Datacap version and feature pack. Different versions of IBM Datacap are not compatible; therefore, you cannot connect an IBM Datacap client with a server that has a different IBM Datacap server version or feature pack installed. Operating Datacap Client or Datacap Web with an incompatible version of Datacap Server, or allowing different versions to access one database, can result in loss of data. \n\nOnce installed, this feature pack cannot be uninstalled. However, you can use \"Uninstall or change a program\" in Control Panel to uninstall the entire Datacap product. \n\nThe language you selected when installing Datacap 9.0.1 determined the language displayed in the InstallShield panels at that time, and also controls the language in which the InstallShield panels for this feature pack are displayed. \n\n \n\nAlerts! \n\n1) When running an update, the global ruleset DLLs are updated but the copies in each application are not updated. \n\nAs a result, new features and fixes are not applied to applications and customers might experience defects that have been fixed. \n\nThe global ruleset DLLs are in the Datacap\\RRS folder.

I can see the updated rules when I review the ruleset archive. It appears the parsed ruleset cache is not being updated. However, I turned off the asynchronous mode as recommended here but this has not resolved the issue.

But if then go into the client application after this, the ruleapp executed from the service layer the is going through the http service is still returning the older version of the rules.\n", "answers": [{"text": "Possible causes for unexpected versions to be executed are: \n- the RES client requesting execution may be passing a wrong ruleset path\n- a hot deploy notification was not sent by the RES console, or not received by all the Execution Units (XU)\n- the ruleset parsing policy may be delaying the use of a ruleset version until its parsing is complete\n- the updated ruleset cannot be parsed successfully and RES falls back on an earlier active version that parses", "answer_start": "231"}], "id": "TRAIN_Q252"}], "context": " TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Why is Rule Execution Server (RES) not executing the expected version of a ruleset ?\nWhat are the possible causes after a hot deployment for Rule Execution Server not to use the updated ruleset ? \n\nCAUSE\nPossible causes for unexpected versions to be executed are: \n- the RES client requesting execution may be passing a wrong ruleset path\n- a hot deploy notification was not sent by the RES console, or not received by all the Execution Units (XU)\n- the ruleset parsing policy may be delaying the use of a ruleset version until its parsing is complete\n- the updated ruleset cannot be parsed successfully and RES falls back on an earlier active version that parses\n\n\nANSWER\nFirst validate that the RES components (the Execution Unit, the Management Console and the Client Application bundling the RES client library, which may be HTDS, MTDS, the SSP or a custom application) have been installed properly as per the documentation, see Configuring Rule Execution Server [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.config/config_ds_res/tpc_res_config.html]. \n\nThe ruleset version that is executed depends first on the ruleset path that is requested. Specifying a ruleset path with no version ( such as /MyRuleApp/MyRuleset/ ) is interpreted as a request to execute the highest version of the ruleset, as opposed to a version specific ruleset path ( such as /MyRuleApp/2.0/MyRuleset/1.0 ). Validate that the executed ruleset path is indeed unexpected considering the requested ruleset path. \n\n \n\nA common situation for an unexpected ruleset version to be executed is that of a hot deployment that is not successfully completed. The more frequent causes for the hot deployment not to happen as expected are: \n\n * Permission issue: the user publishing the ruleset update must have sufficient administrative rights ( Monitor role in WebSphere Application Server ) in order for the deployment to notify all the Execution Units of the ruleset update through JMX. For example on WebSphere Application Server see Mapping the resAdministrators group to the Monitor role [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.config/config_ds_res_was8/tsk_was_map_admin_group.html] \n * Version mismatch between the Execution Unit(s) and the Management Console: in order for the Management Console to detect the presence of execution units the versions of these components must match down to the fix level. For example 7.1.1.4 Management Console would not interact properly with a 7.1.1.3 Execution Unit. The version of the RES console is displayed in the \"About\" link (top right corner). The version of the Execution Unit can be seen in the resource adapter ra.xml file where a resourceadapter-version tag shows the version. For example with the WebSphere Application Server this can seen through: Resources > Resource adapters > XU > Deployment Descriptor \n * Asynchronous ruleset parsing is used : in this mode, while an updated ruleset is being parsed, an earlier version of the ruleset can be used for executions that are requested at that time. Note that there is no guarantee of which specific earlier version of the ruleset may be used since it is a factor of which versions are available in the deprecated ruleset cache and whether garbage collection has occurred. In order to remove any uncertainty on the version that can be executed, it is possible to either turn off the asynchronous mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_asynchron_turnoff.html], or force synchronous parsing in asynchronous mode [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_forcing_sync_pars.html]. \n * Notification scope is limited to one cell : by design the RES notification mechanism only works within one WebSphere Application Server Cell ( or one JBoss domain, or one Weblogic domain ), so a Management Console may only notify Execution Units that are running on servers in the same cell as the RES Console. See XU notification in a cluster over multiple cells [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21458245]. If you need to implement notifications to several cells at once, the document Ruleset updates and programmatic notification of RES eXecution Unit [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21418646] can be useful. \n * Parsing failure of an updated ruleset : leading the XU to fall back on an earlier active version that parses successfully \n * Ruleset update was only written to persistence: writing directly to RES persistence with the ant tasks res-write-db or res-write-file [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_deploy_rlapp_ant.html] does not trigger a notification, so the update may only been seen after server restart. \n * XU MBean is not activated in Java SE mode : See Activating the XU MBean in Java SE [http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/dmanager/v8r0/topic/com.ibm.wodm.dserver.rules.res.managing/topics/tsk_res_config_xu_mbean_jse.html] \n * Multiple Java SE Execution Units are deployed in the same JVM: See Rule Execution Server J2SE mode hot deployment does not seem to work [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21585251] \n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere ILOG JRules Modules:Execution Server (BRES / RES) Platform Independent 7.1.1, 7.1, 7.0.3, 7.0.2, 7.0.1, 7.0"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "I need to understand details regarding Security Bulletin: IBM MQ Clients connecting to an MQ Queue Manager can cause a SIGSEGV in the AMQRMPPA channel process terminating it (CVE-2018-1371).

The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '/opt/IBM/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\ibm\\itm'\non Windows systems.\n\n- If you customize the Extended Monitoring Agent for WebSphere DataPower Appliance \nbn.ini file on a UNIX system, back up this file before installing the fix. \nAfter this fix is installed, edit the latest bn.ini file and merge \nyour modifications into this bn.ini file.\n\n\n5.2 Local agent install and update (including silent installation)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file to a \ntemporary directory on the system that contains the agent code to be \nupdated. For the purpose of this README, the <TEMP> symbol represents \nthe fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. \n\n2. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or \nan unzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory \nstructure that contains fixes for all supported platforms.\n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.3 FP3\nInstallation and Setup Guide\" to install the agent.\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n\n5.3 Remote agent update and installation\n----------------------------------------\n1. Make sure that all potential targets of the remote deployment are\nrunning version 6.2.3 Fix Pack 4 or later of the OS monitoring \nagent.\n2. Transfer the appropriate archive file to \na temporary directory on the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server system. For the purpose of this README, the \n<TEMP> symbol represents the fully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter. \n\n3. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. This expansion creates a directory structure\nthat contains fixes for all supported operating systems.\n\n4. To add the fix pack bundles to the remote deployment depot, use the\ntacmd addBundles command found in $CANDLEHOME/bin on UNIX systems\nor in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems.

Increase the \ntime out value and try the operation again.\n\n\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nFix 7.1.0-TIV-ITM_WDP-FP0003 included changes to the agent\nsupport files that must be installed. If you installed these updates already, there are no additional installation\nsteps. Otherwise, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \nto the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file by using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.3 FP3\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server that is updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThere are no updates to the baroc files included in this fix or\nany of the superseded fixes. No additional installation steps are\nrequired.\n\n6.2 Additional information on new configuration item \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA new configuration item \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" is introduced to support TLS.\nThe value should be SSL/TLSv1/TLSv1.1/TLSv1.2. The default value is \"TLSv1\". \nIf you want to support TLSv1.1/TLSv1.2, please change it manually.\n\n1. For Windows platform:\nThe new item \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" is in KBNENV and KBNENV_<instanceName>.\n\na. Agent instance must be restarted to enable the new configuration change.\nb. The vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in KBNENV_<instanceName> will be updated to \nthe same vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in KBNENV while the instance is re-configured.\n\n2. For Linux/Unix platform:\nThe new items \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" is in bn.ini and bn_<instanceName>.config.\n\na. Agent instance must be restarted to enable the new configuration change.\nb. The vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in bn_<instanceName>.config will be updated to \nthe same vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in bn.ini while the instance is re-configured.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n----------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command\nto view the current version of the agent after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer before viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '/opt/IBM/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME/bin/tacmd listSystems -t or\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t bn\n\nNote: The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (bn), not three characters (kbn).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n07.10.03.00\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthat the agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n07.10.03.00.\nFor the agent on UNIX systems, the version number is\n07.10.03.00.\n\n2.

The feature was enabled by default for the NPS 7.1 releases up to 7.1.0.6 and for 7.2 releases up to 7.2.0.5.\n\n\nThe snippet results cache saves the intermediate results of snippets and can reuse them rather than incur the processing time to recompute them when needed. The cache can help to improve the performance of small queries. \n\nHowever, in environments where queries run against tables that constantly change with TRUNCATE, load, updates, and/or rollback operations, caching may not be a good match if cached snippet results are frequently invalidated before they can be reused. \n\nIf you upgrade from any 7.x release to a release listed in the Environment section and detect a change in query performance for queries that take advantage of the snippet results cache, you can re-enable the feature.\n\nTo enable the feature on a session level and test the snippet results cache behavior, you must pause the NPS system, set the variable, and resume the system, as follows: \n\nnzsystem pause -force\nnzsystem set -arg system.srcMode=1 -force\nnzsystem resume\n\nThis setting remains in effect until the database is restarted.

installation of NMA agent from package ITM for Virtual Environment V7.2.0.3 is failing with both remote or local installation on Linux x86-64. \n\nSYMPTOM\n1) The import of the whole bundle using command: \n\n/opt/IBM/ITM/bin/tacmd addbundles -i <inst_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix\n\nwill fail with message:\n\nUnable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263\n\n--\n\n2) Even if you succeed in importing the bundle, the remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263).\n\n--\n\n3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally on a Linux x86_64, the usual installation procedure does not work for the same reason of point 2.\nThe installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit and so it does not show the expected list of agents.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe causes for the three scenarios depends on wrong prerequisite levels packaged into ITM for VE 7.2.0.3 for NMA agent, and on unexpected architecture recognized by the installer when trying to install the agent on the target node, if this one is a Linux x86-64.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe issues should be corrected at Installer level, APAR IV84919 has been opened to fix them. \n\nAnyway, since the correction involves the installation component, it will not be available until next release, when the Installation package will be built again. \n\nUntil then, you can bypass the issue with some manual steps. \n\n--------------- \n\n1) If the import of agent bundle using command tacmd addbundles fails with message: \n\nUnable to find bundle prerequisite: ci 06.22.04.000 li6263\n\nthis occurs because some agents, particularly N4 agent, have old prerequisites for shared components (ax, ui, gs,jr) that are not part of the ITM_for_VE bundle. \n\nThere is actually a workaround to correctly import the bundle in the depot, but it will not be of any help because remote installation of N4 agent will then fail due to the problem described in item number 2. \n\nIt can be anyway useful to know the workaround as it can be applied to other agents for which remote installation instead correctly works.\n\nYou must verify if the prerequisites mentioned in the error message are already present in your depot by using command tacmd viewdepot.\nBeside of the one mentioned in the error message, you must be sure that also the other wanted prerequisites are already present in the depot.\n\nN4 agent has the following prerequisites:\n\nProduct Code : n4 \nDeployable : True \nVersion : 062200000 \nDescription : Monitoring Agent for Network Devices \nHost Type : li6263 \nHost Version : li6263,lx8266 \nPrerequisites: ci:062204000 la:ipaddr05400 gs:074027000 jr:051201000 \nui:062204000 ax:062204000\n\nIf all of them are already in the depot, then you can run the tamcd addbundles using flag \"-n\" (ignore prerequisites), this will allow to correctly import the agent bundle.\n\nIf you do not have the wanted prerequisite levels, you have two possible options:\n\na) retrieve and add them into depot from other ITM installation packages\nb) modify the agent dsc files and change the level of the components required by the agent to match the level delivered with the bundle.\n\nFor example, ITM for Virtual Environment 7.2.0.3 delivers CI component at level 06.30.05.000, so if we consider N4 agent, you may need to change the file n4li6263.dsc in the rows:\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06</Version>\n\n<Release>22</Release>\n\n<Mod>04</Mod>\n\n<Level>000</Level>\n\n\nto \n\n\n<PrereqProdCode>ci</PrereqProdCode>\n\n<PrereqVersion>\n\n<Version>06</Version>\n\n<Release>30</Release>\n\n<Mod>05</Mod>\n\n<Level>000</Level> \n\n \n\nThe same for other components in case they are also missing from your depot. \n\nThe dsc files are into <installation_media>/ITMfVE_Agents/unix folder. \n\nRepeat the tacmd addbundles command and it should now work fine. \n\nAs previously said, please consider that this scenario may occur also for agents different than N4, and the workaround is applicable also for them. \n\nOf course the target dsc file name changes accordingly to the agent type and related architecture. \n\n \n\n2) The above workaround can help in case the issue is only related to backleveled prerequisite packages. \n\nAnyway, once you applied it, if the target node for the N4 agent is a Linux x86-64, you will anyway not be able to install it remotely.\nThe remote deploy of N4 agent on a Linux X86_64 fails because the installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit while the agent comes with a different architecture (li6263). \nThe quickest workaround in this case is to install the agent locally.\n\n3) If you try to install the ITM for VE agents locally on a Linux x86_64, the usual installation procedure does not work for the same reason of point 2. \nThe installer recognizes the target node as a 64bit platform and the agents are 32bit. \nSo the installer menu will show no available agents to be installed.\n\nYou need to proceed as follow:\n\na) Run the local installation of N4 agent on target machine and proceed as usual when you are prompted with Installer initial questions.\nb) Select Other operating systems when you are showed this panel\n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21983839&aid=1]

In the above example, this is the unicode character 0x0, but there are a number of other unicode characters that can cause the same result. The problem does not occur in the WebSphere Adapter itself because the WebSphere Adapters are entirely capable of handling full unicode data. Rather, the problem happens in some brokers which fail to properly serialize the incoming data into a valid XML object.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe only complete solution at this time is to not process unicode characters that are not valid in XML. This can be done by not importing data fields that might contain such characters or by purging such characters from the incoming data source. It is not sufficient to do filtering in the BO maps since the broker can still run into problems prior to this Java\u2122 mapping. \n\n\nIf handling of fields containing these unicode characters is essential to your use case, it will be necessary to open a PMR with your broker's support team (rather than the WebSphere Adapter team) to determine if there are any alternatives available.\n\n \n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 75349\n344\n000"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Cannot start Maximo/SCCD with error BMXAA4087E - The MAXMESSAGE value for group login and key username could not be retrieved.", "answers": [{"text": "For IBM DB2, the value is COALESCE, and you cannot change the default value. \n\nFor Oracle, the value is NVL, and you cannot change the default value.\nFor SQL Server, the value must be set to ISNULL.\n\nMake sure MXServer is stopped.

These settings are only temporary for the current session and will be lost once the session is over or the terminal window is closed. \n\nThis syntax can be used within shell scripts. Any processes spawned from these shell scripts will also have the temporary settings for the lifetime they are running. \n\nBy default, the soft limit will be changed (as changing the hard limit needs root access). Use -H (for hard limits) or -S (for soft limits) to change specific hard or soft limits. \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn HP-UX, if you receive an error when setting a particular limit, and you have altered that particular hard limit, you may need to check and see if it had exceeded the kernel parameters. You can use kctune to check (and alter) these if necessary; check your HP-UX documentation for more information. \n\nFor Solaris, settings in the \"/etc/system\" configuration file also allow configuring of some kernel-wide limits. \n\n \n\nGlobal Settings \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=1] Any changes to these global configuration limits files should be performed by your system administrator. Instructions on how to edit the files can be found on the manpage or in the commented section of the configuration file, as they can vary between versions of UNIX or Linux. \n\n \n\nThe format of the file, which differs slightly on versions of AIX and Linux, allows individual limits per users or groups, as well as set hard and soft limits. The limits defined in this configuration file are set globally. \n\n \n\nChanges made to any limits file take effect after launching a new login shell (such as bash -l), or if the user logs out and logs back in to the system. \n\n \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn Solaris and HP-UX, changes made to your shell's profile configuration (.profile or .login) should also take effect on the next login shell launched, or when your user logs back in using the specific shell. \n\nFor kernel-wide settings, which usually require a restart of the operating system to take effect, HP-UX has the kctune command, while Solaris has the /etc/system configuration file. \n\n \n\nSpecifics for each Operating System:\nThe most up-to-date information on the limits can be found in the man page for \"ulimit\".\n\n\n\nAIX \nGlobal settings are generally set in the file /etc/security/limits, although there may be different limit files for LPARs and WPARs. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions.

Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). \n\nThere are similar kernel settings you can also set with kctune, such as \"maxfiles_lim\", but these kernel parameters do not normally need to be changed. Please refer to its man page for further information. \nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions.

Most values can also use the string unlimited. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between Linux variants. Consult the ulimit man page or the limits.conf file for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name /etc/security/limits.conf <item> Description ulimit -c [value] core Max core dump file size (KB) ulimit -d [value] data Max data size (KB) ulimit -f [value] fsize Max file size (KB) ulimit -l [value] memlock Max size of address space that can be locked into memory (KB) ulimit -n [value] nofile Max number of open files/sockets per process** ulimit -u [value] nproc Max number of processes for a single user ulimit -m [value] rss Max resident set size (KB) ulimit -s [value] stack The maximum stack size (KB) ulimit -t [value] cpu Max CPU time (minutes or seconds) ** There is a restriction that occurs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux that this value cannot be set to unlimited \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolaris \n\nThere is no global settings file specifically for ulimits on Solaris (however you can set kernel-wide settings in the /etc/system file). Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). \n\nAlso depending on the shell used, the ulimit command is slightly different. See the man page for further information. \n\nYou can also set kernel wide settings for many of these ulimits in the /etc/system file. \nFor example, \"set lim_fd_max = [value]\" and \"set rlim_fd_cur = [value]\" are respectively the global hard and soft file descriptor limits. See the system OS's documentation for information on the /etc/system file. \nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions. Consult the ulimit man page or your OS documentation for further information.\n\n\n\nCommand Line limit_name * \n(sh, ksh, bash) Command Line \n(csh) Description ulimit -c [value] ulimit coredumpsize [value]\n(K bytes) Core file size in 512 byte blocks. ulimit -d [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit datasize [value]\n(K bytes) Data segment size of processes in kilobytes. ulimit -f [value] ulimit filesize [value]\n(K bytes) File size limit in 512 byes blocks. ulimit -n [value] ulimit descriptors [value] Max number of open files and/or sockets per process (plus 1) ulimit -s [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit stacksize [value]\n(K bytes) The stack segment size in kilobytes. ulimit -t [value]\n(seconds) ulimit cputime [value]\n(seconds) Max per process CPU time (in seconds). ulimit -v [value]\n(K bytes) ulimit memorysize [value]\n(K bytes) Maximum size of virtual memory (in kilobytes) * Values are in 512 byte blocks unless otherwise specified, check your man page for further information. \n\n\n\n\nIf I am experiencing Too Many Open Files (Unix Error Code 24), can I increase the number of file descriptors? \nYes you can through the ulimit -n [value] command. However these settings won't take effect until you restart your application server (and nodeagent), making sure you restart on the same command line where you executed \"ulimit -n\". \n\nHowever, if you increase the value high enough and still run into these errors, you may want to check for a file descriptor leak (meaning a leak of opened files and/or sockets in your application code). The command lsof, offered on a variety of operating systems, can provide information on the quantity and types of file descriptors in use. \n\nFurther information can be found at this link: Too Many Open Files error message [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352] \n\n\nOn Linux, can I set the ulimit for the number of open files to unlimited? Certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not allow this value to be set to unlimited due to a known issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=507159]. The limit must be set to an integer value no larger than 1048576. Other versions of Linux may not have this restriction. In the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server, there is a recommendation [http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tprf_tunelinux.html] of 8000. \n\nIf an attempt is made to set this ulimit to unlimited via the command line, an error will be displayed, and the old value will remain in place:\n[root] # ulimit -n unlimited\nbash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n\n\n \n\n[/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=2] If you try to edit the /etc/security/limits.conf file to force unlimited for the number of open files, this will still be considered invalid and it will be reset to 0. This will prevent any new processes from spawning by that user or group. If this is the root user, the system will slowly die as new processes will be unable to generate. A recovery disc will be needed to reset the value. \n\n\n\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, why are my settings for nproc (ulimit -u) not being honored. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has introduced a configuration file, addressed in a bug report [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=919793], ( /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf ) that overrides the nproc setting in the limits.conf. This file contains a line for nproc configured with a soft limit of 1024. \n\n* soft nproc 1024 \n\nThe rationale for this was to prevent fork bombs from occurring, To keep using the limits.conf for your nproc ulimit settings, you would need to comment this line out by making the first character on the line a hash/pound symbol. \n\n#* soft nproc 1024 \n \n\nI am using an /etc/init.d script (or inittab) to start my application server and setting the global ulimit settings had no effect? The global settings for ulimit will not take effect if the init process starts the application server or nodeagent because it has yet to load the global settings. The global settings take effect once a login terminal session is started, or when a user logs in to the system, not when the init process spawns new processes based on init.d scripts. At startup, the operating system hasn't begun to load specific profiles up, even the root user. When you see individual services and processes starting, these are all child processes of the init process \n\nThis was previously documented for AIX 6.1 in the following Knowledge Center article entitled \"telinit or init Command\", under the Environments section. Here's the quoted section: \n\n\"A command that is executed by init from the /etc/inittab file uses init's ulimit values and not the default values as given in /etc/security/limits. The result is that a command that is successfully executed from the command line may not execute correctly when invoked by init. Any command that has specific ulimit requirements should include specific actions to set the ulimit values as required.\"\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Domino for Linux (see step 2)

Although these connections will eventually be discarded through the normal processing of the connection requests, it may be desirable to purge them all at once and allow the pool to refill with new, valid connections.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool. WebSphere Application Server MBean may be called via the wsadmin console, see the IBM Information Center topic \"Scripting the application serving environment (wsadmin)\" for more details. The operation name is: purgePoolContents. \n\nThe purgePoolContents operation has two options: \n\n 1. Normal:  * This is the default option. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. \n     * Shared connection requests will be honored. \n     * Free connections are cleaned up and destroyed. \n     * In use connections (for example: connections in transactions) are cleaned up and destroyed when returned to the connection pool. \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents will be done synchronously (for example: wait for the jdbc driver to return before proceeding). \n     * Requests for new connections (not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2. Immediate:  * No new transactions will be allowed to start on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * No new handles will be handed out on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. Any new activities on a purged Connection will cause a StaleConnectionException or an XAER_FAIL exception (in the case of XA) \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call will be done asynchronously (for example: no waiting for the jdbc driver to return) This is useful if the driver returns. \n     * Due to the fact that close() does not wait, the number of connections will be decremented immediately in WebSphere Application Server. This might cause the total number of connections in WebSphere Application Server to be temporarily out of sync with the database total number of connections. \n     * Requests for new connections (for example: not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n    \n    \n\n\nExamples of operations that can be executed on the data source MBean using the wasdmin console:  1. List all data sources:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,*\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,*\")\n    \n    \n 2. Initialize a variable to specify a data source (this example uses Default Datasource, but any data source name listed in the output of above command can be used):\n    Using Jacl:\n    set name \"Default Datasource\"\n    set ds [$AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,name=$name,*] \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    name = \"Default Datasource\"\n    ds = AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,name=\"+name+\",*\") \n    \n    \n 3. View the pool contents by invoking the showPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showPoolContents\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 4. View contents of all pools by invoking the showAllPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showAllPoolContents\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showAllPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 5. Immediately purge the pool by invoking the purgePoolContents operation of the data source MBean with the immediate option:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds purgePoolContents immediate\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"purgePoolContents\", \"immediate\")\n    \n    \n\nIf the purge operation is successful, no response will be observed. If the purge operation is not successful, the response will indicate a possible reason for failure. One common reason for failure is attempting to purge the contents of a connection pool which is not yet available (the connection pool is not created until a naming look-up of the associated datasource or connection factory occurs), resulting in an illegal state exception.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK Application Servers WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Java SDK z/OS 8.0, 7.0, 6.1"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "TEPS LDAP has been configured correctly.

To see why the messaging engines were not available, check the SystemOut.log for applicable messages. Examine the SystemOut.log file starting at the time period when the application experienced the problem and search backward. \n\n\nCheck for the CWSID0016I which indicates status of the Messaging Engine activity.

The value for the provider endpoints should be in the format of host_name:port_number:BootstrapBasicMessaging.\n\nIn the JMS connection factory, you can define a list of provider endpoints that govern which servers the application will attempt to connect to. If you have defined these endpoints, ensure that the messaging engines for these servers have all started and that the port and transport chains defined in the endpoint list are correct. Also, ensure that the values for the Connection proximity (bus, cluster, host or server) and the Target groups and Target significance settings are appropriate. For example, if the Target significance value is Required and no suitable messaging engine could be located, then this would cause a connection failure. Please refer to the following links for how to set provider endpoints:\n\nDefault messaging provider queue connection factory [Settings] : [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/SIBJMSQueueConnectionFactory_DetailForm.html]\n\nDefault messaging provider topic connection factory [Settings]: [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/SIBJMSTopicConnectionFactory_DetailForm.html]\n\nRestart the server after making the change.\n\n2) If your environment is heavily loaded, the HA manager might not be able to locate the running messaging engine within three seconds.

RES components that interact directly with the RES Console management stack normally expect to find exactly one RES Console within the this management scope : an error can arise from not finding a RES Console management stack, as well as finding more than one.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nCertain use cases are supported that involve deploying more than one RES console in a cluster, most notably for situations where a active/passive fail over is needed, see the following document for more information: Clustering Rule Execution Server (RES) management console [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21426014] \n\n\nHowever there is a number of limitations that one can face when several RES consoles are deployed within the same administrative cell, such as : \n\n 1. The use of the API ilog.rules.session.IlrManagementSession (reference [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/html/api/html/ilog/rules/res/session/IlrManagementSession.html]) may fail with a java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above. In this situation, the only option is to deploy a single RES Console per cell. \n 2. With JRules 6.x deploying RSM in a cell where more than one RES console is deployed can lead to java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above when attempting to add an SSP through the RSM console. \n 3. With JRules 7.x DVS scenario suite executions initiated from Rule Studio to be run on a remote Java EE server in a cell where more than one RES console is deployed may fail with java.lang.IllegalStateException as per the symptom above. \n 4. The use of interceptors (i.e. IlrSessionInterceptor implementations) may fail with a java.lang.IllegalStateException or an error message such as ilog.rules.res.session.interceptor.IlrSessionInterceptorException: Unable to find RuleApp /myruleapp/myruleset for use by the interceptor. In this situation, the only option is to deploy a single RES Console per cell.\n\n\nFor situations 2. and 3. note that DVS and RSM are normally deployed in a non-production environment since they support the testing process of the rules prior to their deployment to production. So in practice it is not necessary to deploy multiple RES console instances for fail over purpose when in a testing environment. The recommendation is then to set up RES console and SSP in a testing cell that is separate from the production cell. In this testing cell, only one instance of RES console should be installed.

Non-SSL requests might come in the form of GET hostname:port/URI, whereas for SSL requests, the proxy servers, more often than not, are configured to channel the request from the client to the server.\n\nISSUE RESOLUTION\nFor Non-SSL Proxy requests, an XML Firewall can be used in the HTTP Options tab to configure the Proxy Host and Port, or a Multi-Protocol Gateway can be used to set up an HTTP Proxy Policy in the User Agent. For SSL Proxy requests, the Multi-Protocol Gateway should be used in the User Agent's HTTP Proxy Policy to implement the CONNECT method for SSL Tunneling. Note that the XML Firewall service is not designed to utilize the CONNECT method for SSL Tunneling."}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What can cause issues with the execution of certain commands in MySQL databases when working with Python?", "id": "61a89a43-550a-47bb-8c2b-5a83fe5ec38f", "answers": [{"text": "a SQL query in Python to retrieve data from a MySQL database might fail due to the incorrect use of SELECT syntax.", "answer_start": 216}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How can users resolve problems they face while retrieving data from a MySQL database using Python?", "id": "b9859034-51f2-4231-af09-2575cfa46f8d", "answers": [{"text": "users need to use the MySQL Connector, a library for connecting a Python program to a MySQL database.

Languages like Python require certain mechanisms to interact with MySQL databases. For instance, a SQL query in Python to retrieve data from a MySQL database might fail due to the incorrect use of SELECT syntax.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nTo retrieve any data from a MySQL database using Python, users need to use the MySQL Connector, a library for connecting a Python program to a MySQL database. When writing a SQL query, the syntax should be SELECT column_name FROM table_name, and this query should be executed using the fetchall() function. Efforts should be made to adhere to the respective syntax standards, as failure to do so can result in errors or ineffective commands.\n\nExample Context:\n\nCAUSE\n\nWhile using MongoDB databases, there could be instances where users might face challenges in querying for documents that contain certain types of data. Suppose a document has an array field, and the user wants to query documents based on values within that array.\n\nANSWER\n\nTo overcome this issue in MongoDB, users can use the $in operator within a query, which matches any value in an array. For example, to find documents where the array field contains a value \"example\", the query would be {field: {$in: [\"example\"]}}. This specific method of querying is useful when dealing with array fields in documents. It is also recommended to refer to MongoDB's official documentation for more detailed information about querying documents."}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What problem may occur when using Microsoft SQL Server?", "id": "dac05603-94bc-4496-868c-c27c59db6974", "answers": [{"text": "there are special symbols that affect the query execution.", "answer_start": 42}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What's the solution if you're trying to search for a string with an underscore in Microsoft SQL Server?", "id": "390e7431-07c0-480a-ae7f-17c726971025", "answers": [{"text": "you should use the escape character \"^\".

Here's how you can check the Python interpreter's maximum memory uptake allowance: \n\na) Open your command line or terminal and go to the <INST>/lib/python<version> folder \nb) Run this command: python -Xmx2048m hello\n- If Python is comfortable with 2GB assignment, \"ModuleNotFoundError\" for hello will be the error you'll receive\n- An alternative error message might surface, typically \"MemoryError\", if Python doesn't accept it\n- To find the limit, gradually push the Xmx value higher until a problem arises\n- In terms of a 32-bit Python interpreter, exceeding 2048m is deemed inadvisable, whereas, for 64-bit systems, it can be up to half of your total physical memory.\n\nRestart the server once you adjust these settings so that the changes become operative.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO Understanding Python's Memory Management [http://digi.com/pythonmemory]\nPython's Garbage Collection Revealed [http://www.example.com/python/garbagecollection]"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What does 1 PetaByte equal in kilobytes?", "id": "9801b0ec-bde4-4f72-bedd-10a301e1098a", "answers": [{"text": "1 PetaByte equals 1024*1024*1024*1024 kilobytes.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How can I check my computer's maximum RAM capacity?", "id": "cad813a6-697f-476e-b7a0-ebf23da2755f", "answers": [{"text": "Open command line / shell script and navigate to C://Windows/System32\nb) Run this command: wmic memorychip get capacity", "answer_start": 218}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the maximum RAM support for a 32-bit operating system?", "id": "57327e8d-7519-4592-bf46-5a7ad22d6605", "answers": [{"text": "For a 32-bit operating system, maximum RAM support is usually 4GB", "answer_start": 493}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How can I remove a user from the server access list?", "id": "f0025264-b20a-4384-b2f5-6a3130faae32", "answers": [{"text": "REMOVE USER('user account') TYPE(ADMIN) PERMISSION(DENY) ACTION(REMOVE)", "answer_start": 950}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What error is displayed when trying to remove a user account that cannot be found?", "id": "4fd09d83-ccc5-4ca9-8d82-80d3ce11c233", "answers": [{"text": "ERROR1: User account not found", "answer_start": 1066}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which action parameter is not suitable for removing a user authentication record?", "id": "ac3e7085-db50-41b8-8a30-c8d9b73ad9bd", "answers": [{"text": "The attribute LOCATION is not a valid parameter for the REMOVE action.", "answer_start": 1364}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "1 PetaByte equals 1024*1024*1024*1024 kilobytes.

An example of this issue can be observed when two distinct realms (DC=company1, DC=example) are mapped to the Master Portal and a Virtual Portal (DC=company2, DC=example) respectively. If a replication process (i.e., syndication) is initiated, an error occurs, which manifests as an 'Unexpected exception' with an indication of 'MemberNotFound'. This happens because the Admin user exists on the Master Portal but not in the Realm attached to the Virtual Portal. An Admin user who is also the Domain Admin retrieved through UserManagementServiceImpl.getPortalAdministrator() would not have access to the Virtual Portal. To rectify this, the Admin user has to be made accessible to both the Master and the Virtual Portals for the successful syndication to occur. \n\nContext: Software infrastructures such as IBM MQ face issues when there's cross-referencing within diverse business integrations. These complications often stem from complex interactions between different components within the platforms used. In the scenario of IBM MQ Advanced for Developers, for instance, a unique problem might be encountered in the way MQ functions within states or segments. Immediate feedback and troubleshooting help users avoid errors in future operation, thereby improving overall system efficiency. The key is to fully understand the integration points and mechanisms and apply the necessary corrective measures effectively.\n"}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What settings have been observed to increase efficiency and reliability in Oracle database connectors?

UNDERLYING REASON The IBM Jazz for Service Management framework contains the Dashboard Application Services Hub service and the Tivoli Common Reporting service. Dashboard Application Services Hub supports Firefox Quantum v60 because its bundled libraries like Dojo are compatible with Firefox Quantum v60. But, the integrated version of Cognos Business Intelligence v10.2.2 within Tivoli Common Reporting supports Firefox Quantum v60 in compatibility mode. Launching Tivoli Common Reporting from Dashboard Application Services Hub triggers browser mode compatibility issues, causing Cognos Analytics Studio functions to malfunction.

Conversely, the fixed version of Cognos Analytics v11.0 within Tivoli Common Reporting only supports Internet Explorer v12 in compatibility mode.

Users can apply the db2cat command i.e., db2cat -db <dbname> -n <TableName> -s <Schema> -t. If the output under 'Table not logged' reads '1', the table was created as NLI.
